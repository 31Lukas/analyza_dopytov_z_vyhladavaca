CNN,1,"Perfect storm' of disease ahead with vaccines delayed and measles cases up, WHO and UNICEF say","The World Health Organization and the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund warned of an increased risk of measles spread, with worldwide cases up nearly 80% so far in 2022 compared with 2021. Almost 17,338 measles cases were reported worldwide in January and February 2022, compared to 9,665 during the first two months of 2021, the organizations said in a news release on Wednesday, noting there were 21 ""large and disruptive"" outbreaks, many in Africa and the East Mediterranean region. ""Pandemic-related disruptions, increasing inequalities in access to vaccines, and the diversion of resources from routine immunization are leaving too many children without protection against measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases,"" the organizations said, adding that as cities and countries relax Covid-19 pandemic restrictions, measles outbreaks become more likely.
""It is encouraging that people in many communities are beginning to feel protected enough from COVID-19 to return to more social activities. But doing so in places where children are not receiving routine vaccination creates the perfect storm for the spread of a disease like measles,"" Catherine Russell, UNICEF executive director, said in the release.
Twenty-three million children missed out on childhood vaccinations in 2020, the organizations said. Childhood vaccination campaigns have been hindered recently by the Covid-19 pandemic and conflicts in Ukraine, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Afghanistan.
As of April 1, ""57 vaccine-preventable disease campaigns in 43 countries that were scheduled to take place since the start of the pandemic are still postponed, impacting 203 million people, most of whom are children,"" the organizations said. ""Of these, 19 are measles campaigns, which put 73 million children at risk of measles due to missed vaccinations."" According to WHO and UNICEF, ""coverage at or above 95 per cent with two doses of the safe and effective measles vaccine can protect against measles."" In all five countries with the highest cases in the last year, first dose coverage was below 70% in 2020. In the US, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published data last week that showed measles vaccinations in kindergarten students dropped to 93.6% in the 2020-2021 school year.
""We are concerned that missed routine vaccinations could leave children vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough, which are extremely contagious and can be very serious, especially for babies and young children,"" Dr. Shannon Stokley, deputy director of the CDC's Immunization Services Division said of the release of the vaccination data.",Virginia Langmaid,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/health/who-unicef-measles/index.html
CNN,2,Pfizer requests FDA authorization for Covid-19 booster for kids 5 through 11,"Pfizer and BioNTech said Tuesday that they have submitted an application to the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization of a booster dose of Covid-19 vaccine for children 5 through 11. The companies have said that a third vaccine dose raised Omicron-fighting antibodies by 36 times in this age group. In an analysis of 140 children with no evidence of prior Covid-19 infection, antibody levels against the original strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were six times higher one month after a booster dose than a month after the second vaccine dose. Studies from the New York State Department of Health and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the effectiveness of Pfizer's vaccine for children ages 5 to 12 dropped substantially during the Omicron surge, falling from 68% to about 12% against Covid-19 infection. However, two doses continued to provide protection against more severe illness resulting in urgent care or hospitalizations. More than 10,000 children between the ages of 6 months and 12 years are enrolled in Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine trials at study sites around the world. The companies expect to submit data from these trials focused on children younger than 5 in the coming months. That age group is the only one for which a Covid-19 vaccine has not been authorized in the US.
Pfizer and BioNTech said they plan to submit this data to the European Medicines Agency and other regulatory agencies for authorization in the coming weeks.",Jen Christensen,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/26/health/pfizer-booster-eua/index.html
CNN,3,FDA approves remdesivir to treat young children with Covid-19,"The US Food and Drug Administration announced Monday that it has expanded approval of the Covid-19 drug remdesivir to treat patients as young as 28 days and weighing about 7 pounds. This is the first Covid-19 treatment approved for children younger than 12. To be eligible for treatment, the FDA said, children must be hospitalized or have mild to moderate Covid-19 and high risk for progressing to severe Covid-19, even if they are not hospitalized. The drug, made by Gilead Sciences and sold as Veklury, had been approved to treat certain adults and patients 12 and older who weighed at least 88 pounds. It's given as an injection. ""As COVID-19 can cause severe illness in children, some of whom do not currently have a vaccination option, there continues to be a need for safe and effective COVID-19 treatment options for this population,"" Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a news release. ""Today's approval of the first COVID-19 therapeutic for this population demonstrates the agency's commitment to that need.""
There is no Covid-19 vaccine authorized for children younger than 5 in the United States. The FDA's approval of remdesivir for young children is ""great,"" said Dr. Daniel Griffin, an instructor in clinical medicine and associate research scientist in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics at Columbia University.
Griffin called remdesivir a ""very effective antiviral"" at preventing the progression of Covid-19 to a more severe illness, lowering the risk of hospitalization or death, when given early in the course of Covid-19 infection. ""More recently, the results have come out -- it was a really landmark paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine -- showing that if you give remdesivir in the first five days, during the acute viral phase, before you wait for the door to close, you could prevent progression by almost 90%. It was 87% in that study. So remdesivir actually can be a very effective antiviral if you give it at the right time in the right patient,"" Griffin said Monday.
""If we can extend this down to children and actually give it to them during the critical time when it can make the biggest difference, finally, we're really opening up more options, because these kids don't have a lot of options,"" he said. ""They don't have access to some of the other therapies that are restricted to that over-12 age group.""","Jamie Gumbrecht, Jacquelin Howard",https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/25/health/fda-remdesivir-covid-treatment-young-children/index.html
CNN,4,How well is our immunity holding up against Covid-19?,"Now that most US cities and states have dropped masking requirements and other precautions against Covid-19, you may be wondering about your chances of getting infected or, worse, being hospitalized or dying if you happen to get sick. Researchers have been digging into that question, and in general, what they've found is that for people who are considered up to date on their Covid-19 vaccines -- that means getting a booster when it's recommended -- protection against illness drops off over three or four months after your last dose, but protection against hospitalization and death remains high. Here's why: Antibodies -- the front-line defenders of the immune system -- gradually drop off after an infection or vaccination. Over a few months, they fade away, and that's normal. But it leaves your body open to another viral invasion. The good news is that although immune defense begins with antibodies, it doesn't end there. Other cells like B cells and T cells remain imprinted with the memory of the virus or vaccine, so they can make another antibody army if they encounter that pathogen again. It takes some time to build that army, so while your body is gearing up to fight, you might get a few symptoms. In the end, though, your immune system should ride to the rescue and help you recover without too much fuss. In general, this is how it's supposed to work. But sometimes, this process doesn't go as planned for everyone. Older adults and those with lower immune function may need extra help to prevent the worst outcomes from a Covid-19 infection. Protection after infection Data presented this week to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices breaks this down. Here's how protection is holding up in real life against an infection by the Omicron coronavirus variant that causes symptoms. If you got: Two doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, they're are 30% effective between two and four months after your shots.
One dose of Johnson & Johnson and one dose of an mRNA shot from Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna, your vaccines are 55% effective between months 2 and 4.
Three doses of an mRNA shot, your vaccines are 63% effective between months 2 and 4. After five months, boosters offer almost no protection against Omicron infection, according to data from the UK's Health Security Agency. Protection against hospitalization with low immune function When it comes to emergency care or hospitalization, the protection you get from vaccines really depends on your immune function. Sara Tartof, an epidemiologist for Kaiser Permanente in Southern California, has been studying how well a third dose of the Pfizer mRNA vaccine is doing at keeping adults in her health system out of the hospital. Up to three months after a third dose, the vaccine's effectiveness against hospitalization was 85%, but it fell to 55% after three months. After a closer look, though, she found that these results were largely driven by immune status. ""We saw no evidence of waning but in the immunocompromised,"" Tartof said. ""In the immunocompromised, vaccine effectiveness basically starts low and gets lower."" But for people with regular immune function, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization stayed high -- about 86% -- after three months. Her initial study results are published in The Lancet Repiratory Medicine. Tartof says she plans to update them soon with results by immune status. In general, researchers are finding that for adults 50 and older whose immune systems are working normally, protection starts high and remains high -- about 84% -- for up to six months after a booster dose, when it comes to the risk of being hospitalized with an infection caused by the Omicron variant. For adults 50 and older who have reduced immune function, such as those who've had solid organ transplants or who are getting cancer treatment, protection from a booster is initially good but falls faster. For example, up to two months after a booster dose of an mRNA vaccine, an immunocompromised adult can expect 81% protection from hospitalization if they get an infection caused by the Omicron variant, but that drops to about 49% after four months, according to new CDC data. This is one of the reasons this group has been prioritized for additional boosters.
 Immune protection after infection A study published this week in the journal JAMA Network Open found that unvaccinated people who had recovered from Covid-19 were about 85% less likely to get it again, compared with people who were unvaccinated and uninfected. People who had recovered from infection were about 88% less likely to be hospitalized than those were unvaccinated. The researchers said this protection was on par with that conferred by mRNA vaccines and remained stable up to nine months after the infection. The CDC says that about 90% of people who get Covid-19 will generate antibodies after their infections. But how much protection you get from an infection depends on your symptoms. People with symptoms will make more antibodies than those without, and people who were hospitalized make more antibodies than those who were not. However, all bets are off when it comes to Omicron. A recent study from Qatar found that while a prior infection was highly protective -- about 90% -- against reinfection by the Alpha, Beta and Delta variants, it fell to just 56% against Omicron. Serious outcomes after infection were rare. Experts agree that getting a Covid-19 infection isn't a great way to build immunity because it can be so unpredictable, even deadly. But if you've had one, you are likely have some protection from it, and people should be able to count on that when thinking about risk, Dr. Dorry Segev, a transplant surgeon at NYU's Grossman School of Medicine, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. ""Covid is a high-risk, high-consequence way of getting immunity. But if you had Covid and you went through that and you have immunity, that is something we need to respect, and we need to incorporate in the ways we draw the new social contract of Covid,"" Segev said.",Brenda Goodman,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/22/health/immunity-against-covid-19/index.html
CNN,5,When will the US have a Covid-19 vaccine for the youngest children?,"It's been more than a year since adults first got Covid-19 vaccines, but about 18 million children under 5 in the US are still waiting -- and will probably have to wait until the summer, despite some predictions that shots would be available in the first part of 2022. While Moderna has shared some data on two doses of Covid-19 vaccine for younger children, Pfizer and BioNTech's data on three doses for younger children is not yet available. The US Food and Drug Administration is weighing whether to consider emergency use authorization for both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines for young children at the same time, rather than considering them separately, Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to President Biden, said Thursday. ""Two products that are similar but not identical, particularly with regard to the dose, and what the FDA wants to do is to get it so that we don't confuse people to say 'this is the dose. This is the dose regimen for children within that age group of 6 months to 5 years,' "" Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN's Kasie Hunt. The Pfizer vaccine was made to protect against the original strain of the coronavirus, and the initial series of two 3-milligram doses tested in kids under 5 wasn't powerful enough to keep them safe from the more infectious Omicron variant. ""It didn't meet the criteria for efficacy,"" Fauci said. ""There was never a safety issue, but it didn't meet the criteria, which then had them go back and do a study with a third dose as a part of the primary regimen."" Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said the goal is to have its Covid-19 vaccine available for kids 4 and younger by summer. ""I hope, we will aim to make it in June,"" Bourla said on the ""In the Bubble with Andy Slavitt"" podcast, posted Monday. He said the FDA has been extremely collaborative and flexible during this testing and authorization process. In a statement, the FDA said it couldn't comment on any particular company's Covid-19 vaccine EUA request but noted ""that at this time, we do not have a complete EUA request in house to consider for children under 5 years of age."" ""We continue to engage with companies to discuss their data, but we cannot adjudicate a decision on any vaccine without a complete EUA request, in order to allow us to do our thorough review. Any timeline on these actions is driven by when the data are provided to FDA and fully support a regulatory action,"" FDA spokesperson Abby Capobianco said. Pfizer studying third doses When Pfizer and BioNTech were testing their vaccine for younger children with two doses, the FDA asked the companies to submit a request for emergency use authorization of that regimen; they said would continue to test a third dose as the two-dose regimen moved through the regulatory process. In mid-February, the plan changed again. Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said the agency needed to see data on the third vaccine dose in these younger children in order to move forward with emergency use authorization. Scientists working on clinical trials for the youngest children have the benefit of observing what happens with other age groups. After seeing breakthrough infections in 2021, especially with the rise of the highly contagious Omicron variant, researchers learned quickly that adults and adolescents needed additional doses of Covid-19 vaccine. ""When we started comparing not only against Delta, that was the previous one, but against Omicron, we realized the same thing as we realized in adults,"" Bourla said. ""In adults, two doses, they provide very little protection against Delta. The third dose makes very strong. So we realized that this is the case also for pediatric, so we extended the trials to go to the third dose. ""We will provide you pretty soon data on the third dose, which we think will provide dramatically higher results,"" Bourla told Slavitt. 'Safety is of paramount importance' Moderna has said its vaccine for younger children had a favorable safety profile, and for the Pfizer vaccine, Bourla said ""so far, that the safety looks very, very good."" ""My expectation is that we will have zero issues with safety. We're waiting to see the efficacy, and my expectation is that it will be very good,"" Bourla said. ""Safety is of paramount importance,"" Bourla said, which is why the company went with a lower dose of vaccine for young children than what's used in adults. The biggest questions that remain for the Pfizer vaccines are exactly how protective the vaccines are, what the right vaccine schedule and dose is. The trials should answer these questions. If the vaccine is authorized, little kids could get it on a different schedule than adults and adolescents. Rather than waiting four or five months before a third dose like older ages, the youngest age group could get a third shot as quickly as two months after the second. Children are less likely than adults to be hospitalized or to die from Covid-19, but at least 463 children 4 and younger have died from the disease, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""We need [the vaccines],"" said Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center and professor of pediatrics in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and a member of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. ""This virus is going to be with us until I'm dead. I can promise you that. ""We still vaccinate children against polio in this country, and we haven't had polio in this country for almost 50 years. Why? Because it still exists in this world. This virus is going to exist in the world and continue to do harm."" Offit said the world is going to need a population that's highly immune to the coronavirus for a ""very long time."" ""Every year, 3½ to 4 million children are born in this country who are unprotected. They are going to need to be protected for some time,"" he said. ""And the sooner the better, the sooner you can do it safely."" Moderna moves ahead with two doses Moderna has also been working on a vaccine for younger children. Dr. Paul Burton, the company's chief medical officer, said at the end of March that a vaccine for this age group is a ""huge priority."" The company plans to submit its application to the FDA and other regulators around the world ""just as soon as we can."" Moderna said its Covid-19 vaccine performs as well in children as it does in adults. Two 25-microgram doses provided a similar immune response for children 6 months through 5 years as two 100-microgram doses for adults 18 to 25, the company said, indicating that the benefit conferred to young adults is also conferred to young children. The data showed it was safe and had ""a robust neutralizing antibody response."" The two doses are given to children 28 days apart. Moderna said it was preparing to evaluate the potential of a booster shot for all children 6 months and older that would target the original strain of the virus as well as the Omicron variant. Burton told Yahoo Finance last month that he wanted to be ""realistic for the parents waiting."" ""We're still talking a couple of months to the availability of the vaccine. This is not a couple of weeks,"" he said. Steps parents can take now While parents are waiting to vaccinate their little ones, there is something they can do to protect the children. All adults who interact with the children should be vaccinated, the experts say, and ideally boosted. Adults are also advised to use masks around unvaccinated children, even as many mandates have fallen away. Dr. Doran Fink, who oversees the FDA's clinical and toxicological review of investigational and US-licensed vaccines, told the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Wednesday that he understood parents' concerns. He also promised that the FDA would work ""diligently"" to verify any data submitted. ""We know that many parents and caregivers and health care providers are anxious to have Covid vaccines available for this age group,"" Fink said. ""I do want to reassure the committee and the public that we understand this concern, and we want to have available safe and effective vaccines for all age groups who will benefit from them.""",Jen Christensen,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/22/health/vaccine-timeline-under-5-wellness/index.html
Fox,1,FDA panel endorses Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine booster with 2-month gap for ages 18 and up,"A Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committee on Friday endorsed an emergency authorization for the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine booster when administered at least two months after the initial dose among people ages 18 years and older. The vote was 19-0. The recommendation is not final and will go before the FDA to issue an official decision. The FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) was charged with weighing whether safety and effectiveness data supported an emergency authorization for a booster shot at two months following the initial dose, stemming from a trial involving 30,000 participants. The panel’s vote Friday applied to all individuals ages 18 and older, while the panel previously endorsed authorizations for the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna booster shots across certain high-risk groups, like adults over age 65 and people ages 18-64 at high risk of exposure and severe COVID-19 disease. Company findings presented during the meeting Friday indicated the initial dose was 74% effective against severe disease and 70% protective against symptomatic disease, however a booster shot administered at two months increased protection to 94%, according to Dr. Penny Heaton, global therapeutic area head at Janssen. However, studies indicated ranging efficacies, and surveillance data found the initial shot was 68% effective against hospitalization among adults without immunocompromising conditions. Protection from the initial dose was durable over time, Heaton said, which contrasts to the fading protection seen with the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. However, the J&J vaccine offers less protection compared to the mRNA shots, even with their waning, Cohn noted. ""The reality is that your vaccine does seem to be holding up actually quite well in terms of durability, so the immediate need for a booster is not apparent,"" panel member Dr. Michael Kurilla told J&J officials, but he noted some potential benefit against emerging variants. Of note, panel members noted concern that the FDA hadn’t yet conducted full independent analyses or verification of the company-submitted data including thousands of patients, which would have taken months to review, according to Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Uptake of the one-shot J&J vaccine has lagged far behind vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, at 15.2 million doses administered, versus 236 million and 153 million shots in arms, respectively, per CDC data. In April, federal health officials lifted an 11-day pause on use of the J&J COVID-19 vaccine  following a review and the recommendation of a panel of experts who determined it met safety standards despite rare instances of severe blood clots. In an updated safety analysis Friday, J&J officials noted not a single case of the rare clotting syndrome, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), was detected in the booster shot trials. Finally, Dr. Paul Offit, voting member and attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, noted that most people who received the initial J&J one-shot vaccine received it more than two months ago, and the panel on Friday declined to recommend the booster when administered after six months due to insufficient data and a small sample size of 17 participants. What’s more, panel members suggested the J&J vaccine is better fit as a two-dose series with an amended emergency use authorization, instead of a single dose and a follow-up booster shot.",Kayla Rivas,https://www.foxnews.com/health/fda-panel-johnson-johnson-covid-vaccine-booster
Fox,2,"FDA panel endorses Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine booster for people 65 and older, high-risk patients","A U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel on Friday endorsed emergency approval for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine booster shot at least six months following the second dose among people ages 65 and older and those at high risk of occupational exposure and severe COVID-19. The vote was 18-0. The vote will now go before the FDA to issue a final decision. The panel earlier Friday afternoon voted to reject licensure of Pfizer's booster vaccine in people ages 16 and older, at a vote of 2-16. During the deliberations, panel members suggested older, vulnerable populations may benefit from boosters, but noted insufficient data among younger groups and concerns over potential increased risk for heart inflammation, particularly among males ages 16-17. The committee was most recently charged with voting whether the safety and effectiveness data from Pfizer's clinical trial supported emergency use authorization of the company's booster dose among people 65 years and older and people at high-risk for a severe course of COVID-19 disease. The meeting included members of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, (VRBPAC), as well as officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), lsrael’s Health Ministry, vaccine experts and Pfizer representatives. Dr. William Gruber, senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development at Pfizer, noted Phase 3 trial data indicating waning protection over time, from 96% vaccine efficacy within two months after the second dose to about 84% by six months and amid the dominant delta variant. While protection dropped against infections, it remained effective in preventing hospitalizations. Gruber cited evidence suggesting reductions in efficacy owed to waning immunity over time as opposed to the delta variant escaping vaccine protection. Additional data suggested a third Pfizer dose would ramp up protection on par or better than the second dose, however concerns were raised over the potential increased risk of myocarditis. The FDA panel's review included Pfizer's trial results with some 300 participants ages 18-55 who received a booster dose about six months after the second dose. To be clear, the role of the FDA and advisory panel in this case is to determine whether an additional dose can be used, whereas an expert panel advising the CDC (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, ACIP), will convene Wednesday to weigh who should receive vaccine and when, following the FDA's final review. Top health officials last month said this group would likely include health care workers and nursing home residents who were targeted in the earliest phases of the rollout.

Fox,3,De Blasio to pay kids $100 to get the COVID-19 vaccine,"New York City will begin offering $100 to incentivize COVID-19 vaccines for kids ages 5-11. ""Everyone can use a little more money around the holidays but most importantly we want our kids and our families to be safe,"" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement. The new policy will apply to New York City-run vaccine sites and comes two days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use for children 5-11-years-old. The mayor said that getting the vaccine now will allow children to be fully vaccinated before Christmas, hoping that the $100 incentive will drive people to show up and get extra money for holidays. The city is hoping to speed its effort to get kids vaccinated before they travel for the holidays, noting that the updated CDC guidance says that children have to wait three weeks between Pfizer doses, even though the dosage is smaller than the adult dose. The mayor also said that every public school in the city that serves children in the targeted age range will hold a dedicated vaccination day for those students beginning next week, which will cover about 1,070 sites over the course of the week by hitting roughly 200 schools per day. The city stressed that parents should be present to give verbal consent, whether at a school site or a city-run site, for their children to receive the shot, though de Blasio noted that parents and guardians can also give verbal consent over the phone. ""All choices are good choices, but we want to make it available and easy for parents who prefer just to go to their local school building,"" de Blasio said. While millions of doses of the Pfizer vaccine have already been shipped around the country in advance of the guidance, pediatricians in the city say they have not been overwhelmed by calls for appointments for kids to get the shot. ""We do NOT yet have the vaccine in our office. We placed an order last week and are awaiting confirmation about when the vaccine will be delivered. We will NOT schedule appointments until we have it,"" a letter from Uptown Pediatrics in Manhattan sent to families Wednesday said. But city Health Commissioner David Chokshi stressed that parents can choose from multiple sites to get their children vaccinated. ""There’s no wrong door here.

Fox,4,COVID-19 vaccine booster and flu shot: Is it safe to receive both on same day?,"As the flu season approaches and coincides with millions of Americans newly eligible for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine booster, with expert backing for boosters developed by Moderna and J&J, many may wonder whether it’s safe to receive both a booster and a flu vaccine in one visit. ""Flu vaccines and COVID-19 vaccines can be given at the same time,"" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states on its webpage. The health agency advises providers to administer vaccines into different injection sites at least 1 inch apart to differentiate between any local reactions. ""Certainly, if a person has any concerns, they can take them at different times,"" Dr Aaron Glatt, chief of infectious diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau, told Fox News. ""Likewise, there is no reason to wait 14 days [between vaccinations], like it was originally recommended, after getting either vaccination."" What’s more, there’s no current evidence that co-administration will magnify any potential side effects, according to Dr. Fred Davis, associate chair of emergency medicine at Northwell Health on Long Island, who also noted the most common side effect for both involve a sore arm at the injection side. Tim Mack, 56-year-old of New York City, told Fox News that he recently received his COVID-19 vaccine booster and flu shot on the same day. Mack, who has an underlying health condition, said he had the typical soreness from the injections, but didn’t feel as though the flu shot worsened any of the usual side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine. ""I felt a little tired, but not anything more than I had with the second COVID vaccine shot,"" Mack told Fox News, adding that he wanted to receive both shots at the same time due to upcoming family events and holidays. The U.S. recorded a historic low in flu activity last winter, believed to have largely resulted from mitigation measures taken amid the pandemic to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection, such as wearing masks, distancing and practicing hand hygiene. However, this year health experts are warning of a possible increase in flu activity. ""This year our society has opened up more and masks have become less apparent so it’s likely we will see more flu cases this year,"" Davis told Fox News. Health officials urge vaccination against both diseases; the COVID-19 vaccine does not protect against the flu, and the flu vaccine will not protect against COVID-19, Denise Walsh, dean of the school of health professions and nursing and chief global health officer at Long Island University, reiterated. ""Getting a flu vaccine is the best protection against flu and its potentially serious complications, and getting a COVID-19 vaccine is the best protection against COVID-19,"" per the CDC webpage, which advises patients with any questions to consult their healthcare provider.",Amy McGorry,https://www.foxnews.com/health/covid-vaccine-booster-flu-shot-both-same-day
Fox,5,Will Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine recipients need booster too?,"The plan for booster shots laid out by health officials on Wednesday applies to Americans who received both doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, but for the nearly 14 million who received Johnson & Johnson’s one-dose jab, the details are not yet clear. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the data behind the booster plan includes studies that demonstrated waning vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 infection in people who received either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna two-dose shots. The rollout for those shots began months before the Johnson & Johnson vaccine received FDA authorization, however, so the data on long-term effectiveness is forthcoming. ""We also anticipate booster shots will likely be needed for people who received the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine,"" the statement, attributed to the CDC’s Dr. Rochelle Walensky, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the FDA’s Dr. Janet Woodcock and others, said. ""Administration of the J&J vaccine did not begin in the U.S. until March 2021, and we expect more data on J&J in the next few weeks. With those data in hand, we will keep the public informed with a timely plan for J&J booster shots as well."" Earlier clinical trial data, which was collected before the delta variant emerged, showed the Johnson & Johnson shot had 72% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 in the U.S. Last month, the company said new data demonstrated the shot induced a strong neutralizing antibody response against the delta variant, and that protection lasted through at least eight months. The data showed the shot demonstrated an 85% effectiveness against severe disease, hospital and death. Eight months is the mark officials pinned for the booster timeline regarding mRNA vaccines, but it’s yet to be seen what they will decide for the viral vector shot. U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy stressed that the plan laid out faces review by the FDA and the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) before a booster rollout can begin.

ABC,1,"Measles outbreaks possible amid 'perfect storm' of conditions, WHO and UNICEF warn","The World Health Organization and UNICEF are warning of a ""perfect storm"" of circumstances fueling the potential for large-scale measles outbreaks, underscoring worrying signs of increased risk as infections around the globe this year are far above what they were this time last year. In the first two months of 2022, reported measles cases worldwide increased by nearly 80%, compared to the same timeframe in 2021, the organizations said in a joint news release, adding that conditions are ""ripe"" for serious outbreaks of the vaccine-preventable illness. ""Pandemic-related disruptions, increasing inequalities in access to vaccines and the diversion of resources from routine immunization are leaving too many children without protection against measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases,"" the organizations said, adding that the risk for large outbreaks ""has increased as communities relax social distancing practices and other preventive measures for COVID-19 implemented during the height of the pandemic."" Almost 17,338 cases of the highly contagious disease were reported worldwide in January and February 2022, compared to 9,665 during the first two months of 2021. Brewing humanitarian crises have inflamed the issue. ""With millions of people being displaced due to conflicts and crises, including in Ukraine, Ethiopia, Somalia and Afghanistan, disruptions in routine immunization and COVID-19 vaccination services, lack of clean water and sanitation, and overcrowding increase the risk of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks,"" the organizations said. ""The agencies are concerned that outbreaks of measles could also forewarn outbreaks of other diseases that do not spread as rapidly,"" WHO and UNICEF said, noting that besides its direct effect on the body, which can be lethal, the measles virus also weakens the immune system and makes a child more vulnerable to other infectious diseases such as pneumonia and diarrhea for months after the measles infection -- among those who survive. This is not the first time global health agencies have warned of lagging pediatric immunizations being an issue of urgent address. In an April meeting, the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts noted that disruptions to routine immunization programs puts ""millions of children at risk of disease outbreaks,"" and ""large and disruptive outbreaks of measles have occurred in at least 19 countries during the past 12 months."" And in the U.S., as ABC has reported, vaccination coverage for kindergarteners fell below the nationwide target during the 2020-2021 school year, according to CDC data, raising concerns about vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, mumps and whooping cough. Experts worry pandemic disruptions could inadvertently lead to a growing number of vaccine-preventable illnesses among children. In 2020, 23 million children missed out on basic childhood vaccines through routine health services, the highest number since 2009 and 3.7 million more than in 2019, the WHO and UNICEF said Wednesday. As of April 1, 57 vaccine-preventable disease campaigns in 43 countries that were scheduled to take place since the start of the pandemic are still postponed, impacting 203 million people, most of whom are children, the agencies said. Nineteen of those postponed are measles campaigns, putting 73 million children at risk of measles due to missed vaccinations. In Ukraine, the measles catch-up campaign of 2019 ""was interrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic and thereafter due to the war,"" the WHO and UNICEF said. ""Routine and catch-up campaigns are needed wherever access is possible to help make sure there are not repeated outbreaks as in 2017-2019, when there were over 115,000 cases of measles and 41 deaths in the country -- this was the highest incidence in Europe."" As of this April, the agencies said there have been 21 large and disruptive measles outbreaks around the world in the last 12 months. Most of the measles cases were reported in Africa and the East Mediterranean region. Countries with the largest measles outbreaks since the past year include Somalia, Yemen, Nigeria, Afghanistan and Ethiopia. The figures are likely higher, as the pandemic has disrupted surveillance systems globally, with potential underreporting, the agencies said. The agencies cited insufficient measles vaccine coverage as the primary reason for the outbreaks ""wherever they occur."" ""Measles is more than a dangerous and potentially deadly disease. It is also an early indication that there are gaps in our global immunization coverage, gaps vulnerable children cannot afford,"" UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement. ""It is encouraging that people in many communities are beginning to feel protected enough from COVID-19 to return to more social activities. But doing so in places where children are not receiving routine vaccination creates the perfect storm for the spread of a disease like measles.""",Sasha Pezenik,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/measles-outbreaks-amid-perfect-storm-conditions-unicef-warn/story?id=84349818
ABC,2,Fauci said the US is 'out of the pandemic phase.' What does that mean?,"The worst days of the COVID-19 pandemic may be over in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said this week. Some experts urged caution, however, and said the pandemic is still a threat in the long-term. “We are certainly right now in this country out of the pandemic phase,” Fauci told PBS NewsHour Tuesday. “Namely, we don't have 900,000 new infections a day and tens and tens and tens of thousands of hospitalizations and thousands of deaths. We are at a low level right now.” He continued, “So, if you're saying, are we out of the pandemic phase in this country, we are.” Some public health experts stressed Fauci is not saying the pandemic is over, which he also later clarified to CBS News, but rather that the virus is no longer having the same impact in the U.S. as it was a few months ago. In fact, Fauci stressed at the end of the PBS interview, “So, if you look at the global situation, there's no doubt this pandemic is still ongoing.” This doesn’t just mean fewer cases, hospitalizations and deaths being reported but also fewer school closures and staffing shortages in hospitals as well as people resuming activities again, they say. “We’re not having mass closures of hospital beds like we did in January 2022,” Dr. Cameron Wolfe, an associate professor of infectious diseases at Duke University School of Medicine, told ABC News. “We’re still seeing staffing shortages, but they’re not to the same extent that they were for the last couple of years. Activities are coming back online, so I’m at an in-person meeting for the first time in two years.” Wolfe said the danger of overwhelming hospitals and high death rates is greatly reduced because of the number of Americans who’ve been vaccinated as well as previously infected. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 82.4% of the eligible U.S. population -- those aged 5 and older -- have had at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose and 70.3% are fully vaccinated. What’s more, a new CDC analysis released Tuesday estimated three out of every five Americans have antibodies from a previous COVID-19 infection, up from one-third before the omicron wave. “We’re in a phase right now that the number of vaccinations, and also frankly the number of people who have been infected, where our community level of immune protection is good enough that there’s not as many infections taking place as we saw in January.” Wolfe said. “So, the impact that has on the way our community ticks along becomes less.” Wolfe said another reason the U.S. is doing well handling COVID-19 is because there are more treatments available for people who contract the virus. During the first wave of the pandemic, there were few treatments approved or authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. But, over time, several treatments were developed and they are now more widespread. Currently, COVID-19 patients can receive monoclonal antibodies, which is an infusion of antibodies in a lab that mimic antibodies generated by the body, or pills developed by Pfizer and Merck. These treatments have been shown to not only reduce the number of days a person is experiencing symptoms but also dramatically lower the risk of hospitalization and death, preventing healthcare systems from becoming overwhelmed. “We’re in a much better state in terms of having treatment availability,” Wolfe said. “Having access to good medicines that are liberally now available and do a good job in terms of preventing the severe outcomes from COVID I think is a real bonus that we just didn’t have six months ago.” However, other experts are not sure the U.S. is out of the pandemic phase. “We have the potential for spread of new variants across this country, and it tells us that we are not necessarily out of this pandemic phase,” said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor. “This virus has global impact and it means that we see spread in one part of the world.” He continued, “We will likely see a surge here. And so as much as we want to head towards that normal life, I think we’re still months away from fully understanding whether we’re in a position where this virus is not disrupting our daily lives.”",Mary Kekatos,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/fauci-us-pandemic-phase/story?id=84343057
ABC,3,Parents of kids under 5 fed up with lack of FDA action on a vaccine,"Parents eager to vaccinate their toddlers and preschoolers last fall were told a COVID shot for the youngest age group was on its way, with data expected by the end of the year. That deadline slipped. Then it slipped again. Now, with summer travel just around the corner, parents of kids under 5 are fed up. They describe feeling stuck in a kind of cruel pandemic time warp, even as much of the country moves on and people have stopped wearing masks, including on airplanes. Many parents are ready to assign blame. ""I want you, Joe Biden, to call the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) and tell them that they need to act with all possible speed because every day they delay there are children being infected and some of those children could die,"" said Sarah Liebman, a mom outside Portland, Oregon, whose 2-year-old remains too young for a shot. Emmie Fital, a mom of two boys ages 4 and 1, living outside Philadelphia, has opted to keep her kids home from school because her oldest son's asthma has resulted previously in a hospital stay after he contracted the common cold. ""We've been kind of living in Groundhog's Day, every day for two years … It is ludicrous what we are having to deal with as parents right now,"" Fital told ABC News. In coming weeks, the nation's two big vaccine makers -- Pfizer and Moderna -- are poised to deliver key pieces of data that the FDA needs to authorize a vaccine. Moderna was expected by week's end to submits its official request for FDA authorization for its two-shot version. Pfizer says it expects to have final data on its three-shot version by the end of June. How soon though regulators will give either shot a green light remains unclear. Government and industry officials say the data sets for vaccine trials can be complex, and Moderna will likely submit additional information on a rolling basis even after its official request is made. The FDA has declined to comment on pending vaccine applications -- necessary to avoid legal hot water -- but suggested its hands are tied until company officials submit their data. The agency also has promised to make public a new tentative timeline for advisory committee meetings, a final step before authorization of any vaccine. ""Just remember that we can't actually finish our reviews until we actually have complete applications in the FDA,"" said Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, told a Senate panel on Tuesday. Parents though say they are frustrated by these kinds of cryptic comments and that they seem to be learning more about the vaccine's progress from press leaks than regulators. Last week, a Politico report suggested the FDA might wait on Moderna's authorization request until Pfizer could offer more data on its version. In an interview with CNN+, Biden's top medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci confirmed there were concerns within the FDA about authorizing the two different vaccines -- with different amounts of dosing and shots -- on separate timelines. Authorizing them together would give parents a side-by-side comparison before they made their choice, some officials thought. ""What the FDA wants to do is to get it so that we don't confuse people,"" Fauci said. His comments sparked swift pushback from frustrated parents, including Liebman. ""We were told over and over that the best shot was the first one to get into your arm,"" she said. ""So I don't understand why the FDA seems confused. I am not confused. I'm not at all confused."" Fatima Khan, who helped to start up a grassroots advocacy group and Facebook page called ""Protect Their Future,"" which advocates for swift authorization of a pediatric vaccine, said she wishes the FDA was more transparent about what it needs from vaccine makers and what concerns it has. ""I feel like we've been getting yanked around a lot. You know, no one really gives anyone a clear answer, and it shouldn't be that difficult,"" said Khan. Still plenty of questions remain, including whether at the FDA should send parents down the path of a two-dose vaccine if an alternative three-dose is found to be more effective just a couple of weeks later. Moderna has said its two-dose vaccine produced the same level of immune response as seen in adults. But because none of the participants in the study became severely sick, Moderna couldn't give an estimate of how effective the vaccine is at preventing severe illness. Dr. Julie Morita, a pediatrician who has advised the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the past, said premature or complex data can make speaking openly difficult for regulators. ""You want to be careful about what information you're sharing because you don't want to have misunderstandings. Because once you the information is out there it's really hard to pull it back,"" said Morita, executive vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Overall, children are at significantly less risk of hospitalization and death of COVID-19 compared to adults. Still, the number of children who became infected in recent weeks due to the omicron variant is staggering. The American Academy of Pediatrics estimates that nearly 124,000 kids were infected in the past month alone. Since the pandemic began two years ago, 468 children have died as a result of complications from the virus. Fital said she is irked hearing public health officials say repeatedly that the best way to protect yourself and others is to get vaccinated, when so many kids can't. ""What do you say to the 20 million children that have no option?"" she asked. ""They have nothing.""",Anne Flaherty,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/parents-kids-fed-lack-fda-action-vaccine/story?id=84314476
ABC,4,"Millions of COVID-19 shots set to go to waste, as vaccine rollout slows","While top U.S. health officials are urging some Americans to get yet another coronavirus booster shot, local health departments across the country are grappling with a growing dilemma -- how to address a declining demand for vaccines, while minimizing the waste of unused millions of doses currently in state stockpiles and at risk of expiring. Since the emergency use authorization of the first COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. last winter, federal data shows that states received a staggering 720 million doses, and more than 570 million of those shots have been administered. However, an ABC News analysis of state-provided data found that millions of those shots have not ended up in arms, largely due to a significant decline in the number of individuals willing to get vaccinated — with many vaccine doses now left unused in refrigerators or discarded in trash cans across the country. ABC News contacted officials from health departments in all 50 states, and in analyzing state provided data, found that millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses have either gone to waste, remain unused, or will expire in the coming weeks and months. ""It is a tremendous loss of opportunity for these vaccines to not make it into the shoulders of those who need them,"" C. Buddy Creech, director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Research Program and associate professor of pediatric infectious diseases, told ABC News. ""Not only is it a financial loss for the purchaser of vaccines -- the U.S. government -- but also a significant health loss for those who are not yet protected from COVID and its complications."" How some states are working to ensure shots don't go unused Although the total number of vaccines at risk of being wasted is not publicly accessible in every state, available data provides insight into some states' efforts to ensure the shots do not go unused. ""We have worked with local public health to fill orders for vaccine from providers with existing inventory versus ordering new doses, and to redistribute vaccine with soon to expire dates to use up inventory within the state before we order more with longer expiration dates,"" Lynn Sutfin, spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Health told ABC News. ""Our field reps are moving vaccines across the state to help redistribute as needed to avoid wastage."" In Michigan, about 1.7 million doses have been wasted since Dec. 2020, and more than 100,000 more doses are set to expire in the next two weeks. Vaccine dose wastage can result from a variety of issues, including dropped vials and syringes; and improperly prepared, unused, or expiring vaccine doses, various officials reported. ""Most of the wasted or unused doses are reported because a provider punctures a multidose vial in order to give someone a vaccine but does not necessarily have enough people to give the remaining doses before the vial expires,"" a representative for the State Joint Information Center in Colorado, where more than 619,000 doses have been unused, told ABC News. ""This is aligned with CDC's best practices that advise providers to not miss any opportunity to vaccinate every eligible person."" In large states like California, where more than 70% of residents are fully vaccinated, nearly 3.6 million shots are sitting in the state's stockpile, according to state data. Similarly, in North Carolina, where 60% of residents have completed their primary vaccination series, 856,000 shots are currently available under state inventory, while 1.7 million shots have been wasted after the doses expired or were improperly opened. Nearly 760,000 vaccine doses have been designated as non-viable, spoiled, or expired, officials in Oregon reported, but officials told ABC News that such totals are ""not unexpected."" ""As demand for vaccines wanes, we expect there to be a similar drop in the number of doses vaccine providers request and, as a result, a decrease in the number of unused doses. Oregon will be left with excess inventory, but we believe that we have done everything we can to minimize waste,"" a representative for the Oregon Health Authority told ABC News. Many states ordered hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses in bulk in order to ensure they had enough shots to meet demand, but in many cases, the need turned out to not be as high as initially expected. Although the total number of shots wasted in states was high, many state organizers stressed that the overall percentage of wasted doses was relatively low, in comparison to the number of shots provided to residents. Officials said they continue to work to minimize wastage by controlling the amount of vaccine that is ordered and shipped to the state, and by redistributing vaccine when possible within the state. 55 million eligible Americans still without a shot Last spring, millions of Americans flocked to COVID-19 vaccination clinics across the country to get their shots. In April of 2021, when every adult became eligible to get vaccinated, more than two million people were getting their first doses every day. Overall, more than 220 million Americans have received a shot, representing about two-thirds of the U.S. population. Earlier this month, a new study from The Commonwealth Fund found that the U.S. COVID-19 vaccine program is now estimated to have prevented 2.2 million deaths, 17 million hospitalizations and 66.1 million additional infections through March 2022. Now, a little less than a year later, with those most eager to get the shots now inoculated, vaccination rates have plummeted, federal data shows. A sizable group of more than 55 million eligible Americans remain unvaccinated against the virus. ""The pool of people that are unvaccinated is likely to remain unconvinced of the importance of vaccine-induced protection,"" Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor, said, adding that convincing those still hesitant to get the shot will be a difficult feat. In recent weeks, following the introduction of a fourth COVID-19 vaccine dose for some older and high-risk populations, there has been a slight uptick in the overall number of doses administered. However, the number of Americans initiating vaccination remains at a near record low of just over 50,000 Americans getting their first dose every day. ""Efforts including incentives, improved convenience, mandates and targeted public health messaging during a surge have all had various successes in increasing vaccination rates. It's hard to imagine what might influence someone to change their stance especially with cases at low levels and restrictions being lifted,"" Brownstein said. Dr. Stephen Morse, an epidemiologist at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, described the waste of millions of COVID-19 doses in the U.S. as a ""tragic combination of events."" ""The vaccine development was both one of the miraculous triumphs and one of the tragedies of the COVID response,"" Morse told ABC News, further referencing a combination of factors to blame, including vaccine nationalism, in which wealthy countries, such as the U.S., pre-ordered large quantities of the shots, making less vaccine available for the rest of the world, and persistent issues with vaccine hesitancy. ""We naïvely underestimated the extent of vaccine hesitancy and resistance, some driven by what WHO called the 'infodemic' of misinformation and disinformation, which persists to this day,"" Morse said. Vaccine access and wastage a stark reminder of privilege Some politicians and public health experts have raised concerns over the ethical implications of so many shots going to waste. ""The wastage of millions of doses is a stark reminder of the privilege we have had in accessing vaccines while the majority of the world had to wait months. Extraordinary resources and financial investment will ultimately go to waste,"" Brownstein said. Delaware Sen. Chris Coons warned last week that millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses, which were set to be shipped overseas, could expire, without proper funding from Congress. ""I was so disappointed that we, in Congress, could not come together and deliver critically needed global help to deliver the vaccines that we've already invented, developed and purchased, and to make sure that the nearly 3 billion people around the world who haven't yet had a single vaccine dose get some protection against this pandemic,"" Coons told CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""We'll negotiate what we have to in order to secure a chance to move forward and not waste the vital vaccines America has already purchased,"" Coons added. There may be additional ethical concerns about not donating enough shots to ensure that people can receive a full vaccination series. ""There are significant operational and potentially ethical issues around donating vaccines to other countries; is it ethical to donate the first dose when there is no guarantee of a second? What if the vaccine has not yet been approved in that country? Given how rigorously we regulate and authorize vaccines around the world, it is likely no surprise that the process of donating vaccines can become complicated very quickly,"" Creech added. Even if states wanted to donate their stockpiles to other countries in need, with so many doses left unused in the U.S., Brownstein explained that logistically, such donations would be near impossible. ""Once a vaccine ends up at a site, it is administered or thrown out. There is usually no third option of sending it to another site and even lower chance it could go to another state let alone another country,"" Brownstein said. ""These expired doses are a reminder of our challenged logistical platforms. While we optimized for distribution to vaccination sites, there was very little capacity to shift supply especially across jurisdictions."" A continued concern for many health experts is vaccinating the rest of the globe, as they say the pandemic will never truly subside until vaccine-use is widespread and equitable. ""Assuming we won't get immediate supply for most of the world, the best solution might be to retest and determine if we can legitimately extend shelf life,"" Morse said, adding that he does not believe donating short-dated doses is realistic. ""We certainly should intensify efforts to provide vaccine now to those who, for some reason, haven't yet been vaccinated and may now be willing to take it if vaccine is easily available,"" Morse said. ""Unfortunately, in the U.S., I fear we've reached diminishing returns by now. It would have been far better if everyone had gotten two doses early on, which might have slowed the virus down.""",Arielle Mitropoulos,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/millions-covid-19-shots-set-waste-vaccine-rollout/story?id=84111412
ABC,5,More than 100 million Americans have received 1st COVID booster shot since August,"More than 100 million Americans have received their first COVID-19 vaccine booster dose, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Boosters first became available in August 2021 for immunocompromised Americans before federal officials gradually lowered the age requirement. Since then, nearly half of those in the U.S. who are eligible -- aged 12 and older -- have received their first booster as well as two-thirds of people over the age of 65. As of April 18, an average of 85,000 Americans are receiving a booster dose every day, a nearly 9% increase from the 78,000 getting their first booster dose one month ago. When broken down by state, Vermont has the highest percentage of fully vaccinated residents with a booster at 60.2% followed by Minnesota, Wisconsin, Maine and Michigan, respectively. CDC data also shows 55 million Americans have received a booster dose from Pfizer-BioNTech and 43 million have received a Moderna booster. Only 1.5 million Americans have gotten a booster from Johnson & Johnson. The new figures come as COVID-19 cases continue to rise in the U.S. Currently, the seven-day rolling average sits at 44,000 new infections -- the highest number seen since March 3, according to the CDC. Over the past few months, doctors have been stressing the importance of getting an additional shot, particularly as immunity from a primary vaccine series wanes and more infectious variants spread. Additionally, Pfizer and Moderna have released data in the past showing efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines against infection declines after a few months, but a third dose boosts antibody levels. About half of Americans eligible for a booster shot -- approximately 91 million people -- have yet to receive it, the CDC data shows. ""While vaccination milestones deserve celebration, our booster campaign has fallen far short of a success storm,"" said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor. ""Despite targeted public health messaging and wide availability of vaccines, getting to over half the eligible population boosted took many months to achieve."" He added that experts predict new variants will emerge and without enough people boosted, it ""enhances the risk of a significant surge that overwhelms our health systems."" The CDC does not have data on how many Americans have received a second booster dose. However, during a meeting last month of the CDC's advisory committee, it was revealed that only about 4.3 million people over the age of 50 have received a second booster since they were authorized a few weeks ago.",Mary Kekatos,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/100-million-americans-received-1st-covid-booster-shot/story?id=84293826
MSNBC,1,How this 'little ole girl' from North Carolina became a lead Covid-19 vaccine developer,"She’s a globally renowned scientist and Covid-19 vaccine developer, yet Kizzmekia S. Corbett, Ph.D., modestly describes herself as a “little ole girl” from a small North Carolina town. Growing up, she saw firsthand the health challenges and disparities that proliferated in the Black community. “I am from the rural South where ailments such as obesity, hypertension and diabetes plague communities like my own, and actually plague my family to some extent,” said Corbett, the keynote speaker at a Black History Month breakfast hosted by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) and Rep. Anthony Brown (D-MD) over the weekend. The theme of the 41st annual event was “Black Health and Wellness.” “I have grown to become invested in the health and wellness of all people,” she told the virtual audience of several hundred people. “But especially those who are oftentimes excluded from access and opportunities that afford them equal health and also at the end of the day, equal wealth.” Amid the coronavirus pandemic that has left 900,000 dead in the U.S. alone, Corbett has emerged as a leading voice in vaccine development research and health equity. She was instrumental in groundbreaking research that directly led to development of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, after spending more than six years as a research fellow at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center. It is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Last June, Corbett joined the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, as an assistant professor in the Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases. She heads Harvard’s new Coronaviruses & Other Relevant Emerging Infectious Diseases (CoreID) Lab. Its scientists study and seek to understand the interface between hosts’ immune systems and viruses that cause respiratory disease, with the goal of informing development of novel and potentially universal vaccines. “People always ask me: `Why vaccines? Why vaccines?,” she told the virtual audience. “They are oftentimes controversial, but at the end of the day taking all of the controversy aside, the one thing that remains is that vaccines happen to be the most life-saving way to prevent disease in this world.” Still, she’s well aware that due to ideological differences, misinformation and partisan rancor there’s often been vocal disagreement with that assessment. “I’ve been in a bubble since 16 years old, trying to become a vaccine developer. I had been at science labs, I had been at prestigious universities, I had been at the most prestigious vaccine research center in the world. So I hadn’t necessarily understood what it meant [for others] to mistrust medicine in the way I was faced with it, when it was my turn for my medicine to start to save lives.” “Many of the people who were being disproportionately killed by this virus were unfortunately refusing to take the vaccine that I had made,” she added. As a young, Black woman scientist, Corbett has used her platform to address vaccine hesitancy, or as she has termed it, “vaccine inquisitiveness,” especially in the Black community. She’s sought to reassure skeptics of its safety and efficacy by speaking virtually at churches and various community organizations. “I expanded beyond being a Harvard professor to being the community vaccine teacher,” she told the audience. “I’ve become an expert in empathy as much as an expert in immunobiology. And in the same breath that I was a vaccine inventor, I oftentimes served as the vaccine’s cheerleader.” Her efforts have earned praise from everyone from President Joe Biden to NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci. In her introduction of Corbett at the event, Rep. Lauren Underwood (D-IL), a nurse who co-founded and co-chairs the Black Maternal Health Caucus also lauded her journey. Corbett matriculated at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, where as an undergraduate she was part of the prestigious Meyerhoff Scholars Program and a NIH scholar. After earning a BS in biological sciences, with a secondary major in sociology, she went on to obtain her Ph.D. in microbiology and immunology from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “Dr. Corbett's research and contributions have undoubtedly saved countless lives thousands, perhaps millions, and alleviated untold suffering,” Rep. Hoyer said at the gathering, which in previous years has drawn such luminaries as Barack Obama, Vice President Kamala Harris and the late John Lewis, to name a few. “Yet as we wade through a river, hope has stirred our hearts. Successful development and deployment of safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines last year breathed new life into our fight against this virus,” he continued. “The groundbreaking medical advances of mRNA vaccines expanded the boundaries of our scientific knowledge while helping to curb the spread and severity of the disease worldwide. Thank you, Dr. Corbett, and all those with whom you work.” “I was very much mostly a Black woman with a mission and a duty,” said Corbett of her efforts, which are ongoing. “Because people are going to continue to have to hear about the science, about the new technology, and we’re going to have to continue to have the conversations. All the actions that we took in this moment, are going to have to continue to be tangible beyond this moment.”",Donna M.

MSNBC,2,The Covid-19 vaccine and PrEP both require talking about our health without shame,"After over a year of living in fear, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday said the words we have been waiting to hear: It's finally time to begin taking off our masks. That news comes as confirmation that with enough vaccinations, we as a country can begin to let people go back to some semblance of normalcy — at least in small groups. You’d think many people would immediately leap to joy knowing that it’s safe to let people see your face in public, but I am still seeing so many people online and off — especially progressives — openly pushing back on the CDCs decision and the science behind it with distrust. The debate that’s currently playing out among liberals is a version of one that’s been going on in the queer community for years: The battle to get people to begin taking the HIV prevention drug PrEP is a prime case of how stigma and shame only allow viruses to continue. Since the first shutdowns began in March 2020, the pandemic has been extremely politicized, with masks becoming the symbol of our polarization in this country. Former President Donald Trump openly mocked mask use before eventually adopting it himself once getting sick. According to a 2020 Pew study, the divide on masks and political parties stood at 63 percent of Democrats believing people should wear masks outside compared to 29 percent of Republicans. At the time, Democrats were entirely correct. The virus was raging and masks were our first line of defense. But “those who are vaccinated on the left seem to think overcaution now is the way to go, which is making people on the right question the effectiveness of the vaccines,” Dr. Monica Gandhi, a professor of medicine at University of California at San Francisco, recently told The Atlantic. Which brings me back to PrEP. In 2012, the FDA approved PrEP after it was scientifically shown to be up to 99 percent effective in preventing acquisition of the HIV virus. I remember talking to queer men older than me at the time about the new pill. Many of them resented me for having this level of protection available. (Some still do to this day.) It’s not hard to understand why. They had survived the height of the HIV epidemic in America during the 1980s and ’90s, burying more people than they’d like to count. They had been the ones who popularized condoms as the No. 1 prevention tool in fighting HIV/AIDS. But this new drug was not only going to be just as powerful as a condom, it allowed for men to consider not wearing condoms at all. Since then, even as more and more ads roll out explaining how safe it is and its upsides, we still see queer men hesitating to use the pill that could stop the epidemic in its tracks. Like the viruses and thevaccine, there’s no way to tell by looking at someone if they’re taking PrEP. It’s a pill I take myself, but still to this day find THAT people will make snide remarks about why folks are taking it and not just wearing condoms. Those remarks are never because they actually care about ending HIV/AIDS — they’re coming from people obsessed with slut shaming those taking measures to protect themselves. Their rationale — a belief that only “sluts” need a pill like this — is rhetoric that folks taking birth control have also historically faced. It’s the logical outgrowth of the prevailing rhetoric of the early epidemic, which came from both inside and outside the community, that we as gay men just need to have less sex, or just one partner, or no sex at all. In 2019, Pennsylvania state Rep. Brian Sims, a Democrat, came out as a politician who takes PrEP, at least in part to push back on a stigma that he saw as blocking a future where HIV/AIDS was eradicated. “Think this is an invite to talk about my sex life? It's not. Think it's an invite to shame me or anyone else? Grow up.” he wrote in his Instagram post. “'Stigma' is the thing our enemies want us to be stunted by. It literally kills us. It's stupid and we control our own fate. No shame in this game. Just Pride."" He’s 100 percent correct that stigma is what's killing us at this point — not just HIV itself. For years, people have been opting out of getting tested or telling their doctor their full sexual health behaviors for fear of being shamed about it. And instead of that shame pushing folks to maybe wear more condoms, it instead had them performing riskier behaviors, which they then decided to not talk about with anyone, downplaying the need for their partners to get tested. That cycle is partially why HIV/AIDS will turn 40 years old this June, and why community health organizations are doing everything they can to get people to trust PrEP. If this sounds similar to the underground parties we’ve seen reported all around the country that were superspreader events, it should. Shaming people about partying only made them go deeper underground and made the pandemic worse. And while I do plan to take off my mask as someone who is vaccinated, I do understand some hesitancy from people who have experienced the darkest points of this pandemic. We cannot forget that we as a country are still traumatized. These changes, coming so quickly after more than a year of oppressive sameness, are happening in the midst of an “epidemic of grief,” as the founder of Modern Loss, Rebecca Soffer, wrote in an NBC THINK essay. These two things don't have to contradict each other. Doctors and medical professionals now heavily rely on more harm reduction practices that have them engaging with people in ways that don’t perpetuate shame. Instead, the focus is on making people feel good in all their decisions by knowing their risks in whatever they do. We should apply similar practices to a world where, like PrEP, we are needing more and more people to adopt a life-saving medicine so we can control this disease forever and end the pandemic. Vaccines, masks in crowded spaces, and having intentional conversations with friends and family are all practices we need to be more people to support. But not listening to science when it tells you to relax more in favor of telling people to keep masks on if they don’t want to is not the way to a more normal society for all of us. We have to learn how to talk about our health status, clearly and without shame. If we don’t, similar to HIV/AIDS, we will be talking about finally eradicating Covid-19 for decades.",Zach Stafford,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/covid-19-vaccine-prep-both-require-talking-about-our-health-n1267469
MSNBC,3,The world is counting on us': How Pfizer's head of clinical trial experience navigated the pandemic,"As vice president and head of clinical trial experience at Pfizer, one of the most rewarding days for Judy Sewards was on May 10 of last year. It was the day the FDA granted emergency use authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine to include adolescents 12 to 15 years old. It also happened to be her daughter’s 15th birthday. “It was such a wonderful day,” Sewards recalled. “My daughter said ‘this is the best birthday present ever.’” They booked an appointment to get her vaccinated later that week and celebrated by taking selfies together. “I was like ‘alright, you gotta wait a month or so and then you can see people again.’ After that, our life changed so dramatically. I was happy to see her thriving again.” Indeed, it was a full-circle moment for Sewards, who played a critical role in the success of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine clinical trial program. In her role, she led participant and site communications and engagement. Her days were spent ensuring Pfizer had strong relationships with the over 150 trial sites who conducted the Covid-19 vaccine clinical trials. She also helped build awareness about the clinical trials and worked with community, medical and government partners to highlight importance of participation in the trial by diverse communities and put in place new services to make clinical trial participation more convenient and comfortable for volunteers. Know Your Value recently chatted with Sewards about getting through the pandemic’s darkest days and what she consequently learned about her leadership abilities. The conversation below has been edited for brevity and clarity: Know Your Value: What has it been like for you and what has it meant for you to be working in life sciences at this particular time? Sewards: Our purpose statement is breakthroughs that change patients’ lives, Over the 10 years I've worked at Pfizer, something that's always been in the backdrop for me is whatever work that we're doing, even though my arena is really around communications and experience, is that we're helping patients. But it really came into focus during the pandemic. It became so much more meaningful to me. I felt like the world is counting on us. Society is counting on us. And whether this vaccine is successful or not, I have to do my part and do my very best in whatever I was bringing to the table during this time. There was a camaraderie, and a very shared focus amongst the team that was both emotional and in many ways just very personal as well. Know Your Value: Speaking of the emotional and personal side of this all, you have your job, of course, but you were also juggling a lot at home with two teenagers. With the pandemic and working from home, how did that affect the lifesaving work that you do at Pfizer every day? Tell us a little bit about that experience. Sewards: My stepdaughter was in her senior year of high school. She was applying to colleges and she had all the typical high school senior things to deal with. She also has Type 1 diabetes, and so we were especially careful and worried about her and her exposure to Covid. At the time, I had a middle schooler going into high school, going through the high school application process in New York City. And my daughter is incredibly social. . .spending time with friends is important to her. And I think it was just very hard for her during the pandemic, because we had to keep her at home … So, we operated as this very small bubble probably for a year. We did not see very many other people, aside from our immediate family. And I think that took a toll on both girls. For example, my little one had a hard time … She was so used to a full schedule of soccer, friends, activities, events - all of these things. And now she was basically relegated to her room with her computer and her iPhone and having to take a COVID test before she saw her sister. For me, just seeing how both of their lives and their relationship had been impacted by this pandemic was motivation and as a mother, I was like, “I'm working for you guys.” My parents were in Ohio. My dad had some lung issues. I hadn't been able to see mom and dad for a very long time, and I just felt like the work that we were doing both across the antiviral and the vaccine, was for them in many ways too. We were lucky enough to be reunited with them this year before my dad passed away. That was a very special time for us, and in looking back, will be a lifelong precious memory. Know Your Value: What did you learn about yourself in that high pressure environment? And what did you learn about your leadership abilities? Sewards: I really like high pressure situations and generally thrive in them. But I think the biggest learning for me was just pacing. The Covid vaccine project was and continues to be a marathon. It's not a sprint. One thing I learned is how critical it is to set a bold goal and then prepare really well. You need to have a really great plan, but then also to create the space and be flexible enough to adapt, be creative and reprioritize based on what the science is telling us. Ultimately, to ensure that we get to the finish line and do so in the right way. This lesson also extended into my personal life, and my whole orientation also changed. Living in New York, I thought my life was so full. I would go to work at 7:30 a.m. and have a very busy day. Go out four or five nights a week. Everything was a sprint. My daughter was very scheduled, and there were always lots of events or activities. And the pandemic took all of that away. But it created a really nice space to actually recreate. I got the chance and the space to think about my life in a way where I could focus on the things that were really important. It gave me space to say, ""who are the important people in my life? How do I want to spend my time? How do I want to be a mother? A wife? A daughter? A friend?"" I reprioritized and also reflected. I talked to my parents much more. I made space to regularly connect with the people who were closest to me. I got a chance to really get to know the young woman my daughter was growing into. It definitely just brought my life more into focus and made it more enriching in the way that it should’ve been. Know Your Value: There are some incredible women in leadership at Pfizer. How do you feel like the company supports you and how do you support one another? And on the flip side of that, how do you support other women in their careers? Sewards: Pfizer is an amazing place for working women. I'm grateful for the extensive resources offered to us, the flexibility and the respect for home-life balance. And they are committed to ensuring that women are in leadership positions and advocated for. During the pandemic, there was even more emphasis and an acknowledgement that everybody's home life is different and your home responsibilities and work responsibilities may be in conflict or blurred. I think Pfizer did a lot to offer many different services and to be very flexible on defining what working from “home” means … I personally felt super supported. The majority of my team and folks I work with day-to-day are women who have children at home. I think before we were in the pandemic work environment, we've may have talked about our kids and our home life, but it was very peripheral in many ways. During the pandemic, however, I gained an appreciation and I think we all gained appreciation for each other’s situation as working mothers and actively supported one another through it. For example, my coworker Sarah and I have WebEx's just about every day. Simply because of the blurring of work and home time and space, I gained a greater appreciation for what she was juggling as we were going through this journey together. At times, she’d have her young daughter right next to her doing remote learning. And my daughter at the same time might be asking, ""I need help with this homework thing"" all while we were having meetings and getting work done. At the end of the day, because it all had to get done and we were all in this compressed space, it created an environment where we were all able to accommodate and support each other both as colleagues and as mothers. And that’s a huge positive that has come out of this. In fact, many of us who worked closely together during the pandemic created this unique tribe that has now thrived passed the most critical periods. Having such shared purpose really brings you closer together.",Know Your Value staff,https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/business-culture/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-how-judy-sewards-head-clinical-trial-n1290678
MSNBC,4,Covid-19 vaccine booster shots might be needed. Here's what to know.,"On a recent conference call with medical experts from the country, a conversation around Covid-19 vaccine boosters reflected the incredible tension the topic holds. One infectious disease physician passionately implored many of us to put the brakes on the rush to authorize booster doses, even for immunocompromised patients, citing a lack of data and concerns about safety. Another respected vaccine researcher expressed the opposite viewpoint, saying that we are past the time for discussing booster shots and that we should have been giving third shots months ago. This intellectual debate might be moot in a matter of days, as the Food and Drug Administration is expected to authorize third doses of mRNA vaccines, or ""booster"" shots, most likely for selected populations. But as the country remains in the grips of a fourth wave with a variant of the coronavirus that has surprised many health experts, it is worth highlighting what we do and do not know about immunity and vaccine boosters. The human body has an incredibly elegant way of responding to biological signals to turn on its natural immune response. When you get a Covid-19 injection, your innate immunity kicks in within hours. These are different kinds of cells in the blood that rush to the site of the injection to start the body's defenses. It is why your arm might feel sore after a vaccination. Days later, your adaptive immunity starts to ramp up — these are very specific B and T cells, or antibodies, that work with one another to target the coronavirus spike protein. Think of your adaptive immunity as a very specific and diverse response that can remember past infections or exposures; this is the part we are counting on for Covid-19. The vaccine helps to prime your adaptive immunity so that if the real coronavirus is introduced, your body will remember and send antibodies and other cells quickly to help fight the infection. Some conditions do not allow the body to produce a robust immune response: certain cancers, HIV/AIDS, autoimmune diseases and the use of certain medications. Some medications, such as prednisone, which is commonly used for many conditions in moderate doses, including asthma, result in a tenfold reduction in antibodies compared to people who do not take prednisone. Together, these patients are about 2.8 percent of the population, and they are generally referred to as ""immunocompromised."" At a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee meeting, staff members and other experts presented data that patients with conditions that compromise immunity are more likely to get severely ill from Covid-19 and to have lower levels of antibodies to the virus, especially the delta variant. According to growing research, there is also a higher risk for prolonged infection and shedding, which could mean that immunocompromised patients who are infected have the virus in their bodies longer and in turn could infect other people past the current 10-day time frame. We also know that our immune system is less responsive as we age, beginning in our sixth decade. All of these factors also lead to the potential for breakthrough infections that result in hospitalization and death. The idea behind a booster is not new with vaccines; boosters are recommended for several vaccines, including the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccines (also known as Tdap). The idea behind a booster is to re-expose the body to the outside biologic threat (in this case, the coronavirus spike protein) to increase its natural immunity. The tetanus booster is recommended every 10 years because we know that the body's adaptive immunity, referred to earlier, decreases over time. The goal of increasing immunity is not intellectual. It is to prevent disease and serious effects of disease. With Covid-19, the goal of a booster or any other additional doses would be to optimize immunity to ensure maximum protection against serious illness or death. The Covid-19 boosters being considered by the FDA would be the exact same formulation as the first and second doses of the mRNA vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. Both companies have conducted trials to support the use of boosters, noting that third doses prompted spikes in levels of ""neutralizing"" antibodies when administered several months after second doses. Of note, Johnson & Johnson does not have a booster, but it is in trial with a second dose of its vaccine. About 12.8 million people in the U.S. have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, and hopefully any booster guidance will include these people. It feels like an incredibly First World problem to discuss boosters when half the world still needs to get any vaccine, but a growing body of data supports boosters, especially for particular populations. Several countries, including Israel, France and Germany, have already made plans for booster shots in older patients, health care workers and people with certain chronic conditions. Given the mounting evidence, it seems as if there should be little debate that immunocompromised patients are likely to need boosters, as well as patients over a certain age. But the debate is fierce, as noted in my conference call conversations. While it is true that immune response is not equivalent, it is not clear whether boosters will remedy the situation and whether third doses will lead to prevention of serious disease and death. Booster doses might increase antibody levels, but we do not know what level is adequate to lead to protection, and even if we did, we do not have the ability to check every person's levels before or after vaccination. The pace of a pandemic with the threat of variants that have taken many public health professionals by surprise has resulted in a crisis in confidence and communication. As the FDA advances access to boosters, it will be critical to have a conversation with your physician or other health care professional. There are potential risks, and it is worth discussing your situation before jumping to the conclusion that more vaccine is ideal. Even with the booster, many patients will still need to wear masks and act is if they are unvaccinated because of the possibility that a third shot (or even a fourth) might not be enough. At a minimum, people over age 65, immunocompromised patients and patients taking certain medications should ask their physicians about booster doses. Health care and other essential workers who were vaccinated early and are still at high risk because of their occupations, from grocery store personnel to law enforcement officers, should also be considered for booster doses, but data have been a bit more limited in terms of timing and criteria for them. The political vitriol around simple messages about vaccines and masks has made the conversation about boosters even more complicated. The FDA's announcement about boosters should not undermine confidence in the vaccines. Vaccines work. Masks, ventilation and distance work. In the global fight against a tiny virus, we need all the defenses possible. Boosters should be acknowledged for what they are: one piece of this defense.",Dr. Kavita Patel,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/covid-19-vaccine-booster-shots-might-be-needed-here-s-n1276612
MSNBC,5,U.S. Covid-19 'vaccine diplomacy' is catching up to China and Russia's efforts,"What a difference a few months can make. After a speedy public relations-boosting campaign, it’s not exactly clear how effective Russia and China’s domestically produced vaccines really are against Covid-19. That’s an especially troubling development given the rise of the Delta variant of the coronavirus, which is taxing the limits of even the more effective American-made vaccines. The seeming collapse of Moscow and Beijing’s vaccine diplomacy efforts means that the United States needs to be there to pick up the slack, providing safe, effective vaccines to the world. Doing anything less wouldn't just be a missed opportunity for America's standing in the world — it would mean leaving the world at risk of even stronger strains of Covid-19 developing in the meantime. Back in April, NBC News reported that the United States was falling behind Russia and China in leveraging doses of Covid-19 vaccine as a diplomatic tool: ""Although China and Russia deny it, experts say they are beginning to see how Beijing's and Moscow's strategy of selling or donating their vaccines abroad is greasing the wheels of their international relationships and allowing them to expand their influence throughout the world. It's a development that should cause grave concern for the United States and other democracies, according to former U.S. ambassadors and other ex-diplomats."" It’s less clear now whether the deals in place were all that good for Moscow and Beijing’s clients. The World Health Organization has approved two Chinese vaccines for emergency use globally, both of which are produced using inactive coronaviruses. But the New York Times reported on June 22 that while over 90 countries are distributing shots donated from China, major outbreaks are still ongoing in several of them: ""In the Seychelles, Chile, Bahrain and Mongolia, 50 to 68 percent of the populations have been fully inoculated, outpacing the United States, according to Our World in Data, a data tracking project. All four ranked among the top 10 countries with the worst Covid outbreaks as recently as last week, according to data from The New York Times. And all four are mostly using shots made by two Chinese vaccine makers, Sinopharm and Sinovac Biotech. “If the vaccines are sufficiently good, we should not see this pattern,” said Jin Dongyan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong. “The Chinese have a responsibility to remedy this.”"" That’s a big difference compared to the United States, where the three vaccines in use have caused new cases of Covid-19 to plummet in the months since they’ve been rolled out. While no vaccine can fully prevent infection, the ones being administered in the U.S. are extremely effective — the two-shot Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA-based vaccines each boast an efficacy rate of over 90 percent; the one-dose Johnson and Johnson-produced version is around 66.3 percent effective at preventing Covid-19 infections. The main Chinese vaccines — Sinopharm and Sinovac — have relatively lower efficacy rates, at 78 and 51 percent respectively. But that isn’t to say that the Chinese-made vaccines are worthless or garbage — compared to the alternative, they’re clearly much needed and appreciated as they still manage to keep many infections from developing into severe, life-threatening cases. That’s definitely more than can be said for Sputnik V, the Russian-made coronavirus vaccine. Like China, Russia has doled out doses of its vaccine to friendly countries around the globe like Hungary, the Philippines and Bolivia. The World Health Organization has yet to sign off on the drug, though, despite it being billed as the “world’s first registered Covid-19 vaccine.” And at home, Russians seem extremely skeptical of Sputnik and the two other Russian Covid-19 vaccines. NBC News reported last week that “Russia's vaccination rate is one of the lowest in countries where vaccines are widely available”: ""Just 14 percent of Russia’s 146 million people have been vaccinated with at least one dose, compared to 53.5 percent of Americans, according to Our World in Data, a monitoring project based at the University of Oxford. An ambitious plan to vaccinate 30 million Russians by June — which involved giving away cars and free groceries — has fallen short by a third."" South Africa’s government has shown interest in purchasing doses of Sputnik V from Moscow, despite its reported reduced effectiveness against the beta variant of Covid-19 that first appeared there. The developer of Sputnik says that the vaccine shows less of a drop in efficacy against the beta variant than other vaccines and is thus “much more preferable.” The South African Health Products Regulatory Authority has also yet to clear Sputnik V or Sinovac for use in the country. And as Samuel Ramani, a doctoral candidate at Oxford University, recently detailed in Foreign Policy, Moscow has shown a penchant for overpromising and underdelivering on its vaccine deliveries: ""On Jan. 10, Algeria became the first African country to authorize Sputnik V. Algeria’s budget director, Abdulaziz Fayed, announced plans to distribute 500,000 vaccines free of charge. By April 7, only 50,000 doses had arrived in Algeria, and the large-scale local production of Sputnik V vaccines was delayed until the fall of 2021. This trend repeated itself elsewhere; the combined deliveries of Sputnik V to three of large markets, Tunisia, Algeria, and Guinea, stood at just 100,000 by March 12. Although the African Union recently praised Russia’s stabilizing role in Africa and its eagerness to cooperate with Moscow on security issues, the Sputnik V vaccine deal has so far had little impact."" Taken together, Russia and China’s faltering is in one sense good news for the United States. Last month, leaders of the seven richest countries, including President Joe Biden, announced that the G-7 would donate 1 billion coronavirus vaccine doses to the poorer countries over the next year. That’s well and good — but still around 10 billion doses short of the total that the WHO thinks would be needed to fully vaccinate enough people to provide herd immunity against Covid-19. And while it would be easy to rest on schadenfreude as Beijing and Moscow flounder, this isn’t a zero-sum world where their difficulties automatically boost the United States. If anything, the U.S. is more at risk thanks to their current struggles. As the more robust delta variant of Covid-19 in particular continues to increase its foothold around the world, becoming the dominant strain of the disease, it’s more important than ever that the world cooperate to get needles into arms. Anything the Biden administration can do to meet that goal has to be a top priority — any opportunities to show up global competitors is just a bonus.",Hayes Brown,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/u-s-covid-19-vaccine-diplomacy-catching-china-russia-s-n1272957
BBC,1,Covid: Job losses expected at Wrexham vaccine factory,"Jobs losses are expected to be announced at a north Wales factory manufacturing a Covid-19 vaccine. Wockhardt UK Ltd has carried out the ""fill and finish"" stage of AstraZeneca vaccine production at its Wrexham plant since 2020. Staffing levels were increased to about 500 during the vaccination rollout. However the company said the workforce would return to a ""normal"" pre-Covid level when its current UK government contract ends this month. The factory was seen as a crucial part of the government's mass-vaccination programme and has been visited by Prime Minister and the Prince of Wales during the pandemic. However the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was not used for third booster jabs. The company said it aimed to minimise the impact of job cuts. ""We scaled up at speed to meet the urgent need to supply the vaccine, including investing and recruiting where needed to meet this demanding deadline,"" it said in a statement. ""This has been an unprecedented period in our sterile injectable history and we have not been operating under normal manufacturing timescales or workforce numbers. ""We therefore have made the difficult decision to now undertake a process to 'right size' our business to anticipate and meet the future needs of the organisation without the vaccine work. ""Wockhardt will continue to operate as normal manufacturing all other product lines including critical medicines into the NHS.""",Unknown,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-61222595
BBC,2,Covid: Violence up after lockdown eased and job losses expected at vaccine factory,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. 1. Serious violence up after restrictions eased Serious violence increased by 23% - the biggest rise on record - after Covid-19 lockdown restrictions were eased in England and Wales last year, analysis of hospital emergency data suggests. However, Cardiff University researchers say 2021 levels remained below those pre-pandemic, after bans on social gatherings and the closure of pubs and nightclubs contributed to a massive drop in 2020. The long-term trend also shows violence declining. 2. The struggle to reduce NHS waiting times It will be another three years before NHS waiting times for many treatments in Wales are reduced to under a year, under Welsh government plans to tackle backlogs. Labour ministers will publish their plans later, with health boards set to get an extra £60m over the next four years. But with waiting times of longer than 12 months for 164,000 procedures, the Welsh Conservatives say the plans are ""unambitious"". Plaid Cymru is calling for focus on prevention. The situation is similar to England - in February ministers said the waiting list for hospital treatment will not start falling for two years. 3. Research into cause of mysterious child hepatitis Scientists are exploring any possible links between the pandemic and rare cases of child hepatitis. In the UK, 114 children have become ill and 10 have needed a liver transplant, with health officials saying there's growing evidence the F41 strain of the common adenovirus is linked to the cases. Scientists are investigating whether a change in its genetic make-up is causing it to trigger liver inflammation - known as hepatitis - more easily. They are also looking at whether pandemic restrictions - causing later exposure to adenovirus - or Covid infection might be contributory factors. There is no known link to the Covid vaccine. 4. Job losses expected at vaccine factory Job losses are expected to be announced at a factory manufacturing a Covid-19 vaccine. Wockhardt UK Ltd has carried out the ""fill and finish"" stage of AstraZeneca vaccine production at its Wrexham plant since 2020, with staffing levels increased to about 500 during the vaccination rollout. However, the company says the workforce will return to a ""normal"" pre-Covid level when its current UK government contract ends this month. 5. 'Bolsonaro' dancer turned into crocodile First, Jair Bolsonaro described Covid as a ""little flu"", then he suggested vaccination could turn people into crocodiles. Now the president of Brazil, where the World Health Organization says there have been more than 660,000 Covid deaths, is the butt of a joke as the country's Carnival returns. At the São Paulo parade, a performer wearing a presidential sash transformed into a crocodile after ""receiving a vaccine"" on stage. Satire has traditionally been a feature of Carnival floats, according to one of those behind the stunt. ",Unknown,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-61216740
BBC,3,Covid vaccines: How fast is progress around the world?,"More than 11.5 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 197 countries worldwide. However, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world. Some countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of their population - but others are some way behind. Who is receiving vaccines? With an aim to give doses to nearly every adult around the world, this is the largest vaccination programme in history. Overall, China and India have administered the highest number of doses, with more than 3.3 billion and 1.8 billion respectively. The US is third, with around 572 million. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, together with the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is trying to ensure everyone in the world has access to a Covid vaccine. Covax had planned to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of 2021, but downgraded its supply forecast as a the result of global export bans, production challenges and slow regulatory approval processes. Which vaccines are in use? The vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech was the first approved by the WHO, followed by several others. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now the most widely used around the globe. Unlike Pfizer's jab - which has to be kept at an extremely cold temperature (-70C) - the Oxford vaccine can be stored in a normal fridge, which makes it easier to distribute. Most governments have started with doses for the over-60s, health workers and people who are clinically vulnerable. After priority groups have been vaccinated, there is a wider rollout among younger age groups. The Pfizer vaccine has been approved for everyone aged five and over in the EU, US, UK and other countries. Children aged between five and 11-years old receive a smaller dose of the vaccine than those aged 12 and over. The Sinovac vaccine is being used for children as young as three in China and Colombia. Early studies suggest the Omicron variant of coronavirus is better able to evade vaccine protection than previous strains, though vaccination still offers strong protection against serious illness and hospitalisation. A third 'booster' dose of a vaccine does appear to offer protection against infection from Omicron and at least 157 countries have begun booster vaccination programmes. Worldwide, more than 100 possible vaccines are undergoing trials to test their efficacy and safety. ",Visual and Data Journalism Team,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-56237778
BBC,4,Covaxin: India approves two Covid vaccines for children under 12,"India has approved two homegrown vaccines for children under the age of 12 amid a slight rise in Covid cases. Covaxin, made by Bharat Biotech, has been granted emergency use permission for the six-12 age group, health minister Mansukh Mandaviya tweeted. It is already administered to children aged 12-18, and adults. Two other vaccines have also been given emergency approval - Corbevax for children aged five-12; and Zydus's two-dose jab for children above 12. Corbevax is also currently being administered to children in the 12-14 age group. The emergency-use nod doesn't mean India will immediately start vaccinating children younger than 12 - that can only begin once the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation gives a green signal. India has so far administered over 1.87 billion doses since it began Covid vaccinations in January 2021. The country has recorded a small rise in new Covid cases over the past week, with the capital Delhi accounting for almost half of the 2,500 new infections on Tuesday. About 80% of eligible adults have been fully vaccinated and more than 99% have received at least one jab so far. Since 10 January, India has also been administering booster shots to healthcare and frontline workers, and those above 60 with comorbidities. It also started vaccinating 15-18-year-olds the same month, and later expanded the drive to include children over the age of 12. India has approved nine Covid vaccines, five of which have been locally made. Only two have been widely used. What vaccines had India approved before this? India is currently using four vaccines - Covishield, Covaxin, Sputnik V and Corbevax - for its drive. Of these, Covishield accounts for over 81% of the doses given so far. In February the government had granted emergency use permission to Sputnik Light, a component of the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine, which India had approved last year. The Sputnik V vaccine, developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Institute, had generated some controversy initially after being rolled out before the final trial data had been released. But scientists say its benefits have now been demonstrated. It uses a cold-type virus, engineered to be harmless, as a carrier to deliver a small fragment of the coronavirus to the body. After being vaccinated, the body starts to produce antibodies especially tailored to the virus. Sputnik Light comprises the component used in the first dose of the Sputnik V vaccine. In December, the country approved the Serum Institute of India's Covovax and Biological E's Corbevax for emergency use. It also approved ZyCoV-D vaccine - the world's first DNA vaccine against Covid - by Zydus, but it's not available yet. The government had also approved Johnson & Johnson's single-dose vaccine, which was to be introduced in India through a supply agreement with Biological E; and it had authorised Indian pharma company Cipla to import the Moderna vaccine. But it's unclear when either of those will be available in India. What do we know about the vaccines? The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, locally known as Covishield, is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to look more like coronavirus - although it can't cause illness. Covaxin by Indian firm Bharat Biotech is an inactivated vaccine which means that it is made up of killed coronaviruses, making it safe to be injected into the body. The vaccine ran into controversy after India's regulators gave it emergency approval in January while the third phase of the trial was still under way, sparking scepticism and questions from experts. Bharat Biotech, which makes the vaccine, has since published data suggesting 78% efficacy. Corbevax from Indian pharma company Biological E was developed in collaboration with US-based Dynavax and Baylor College of Medicine. It is India's first indigenously developed recombinant protein sub-unit vaccine. That is, it's made up of the coronavirus' ""spike protein"", which the virus uses to latch on and enter human cells. When injected, this is expected to trigger an immune response in the body. Covovax is a local version of the Novavax vaccine, and will be produced by the Serum Institute of India, which is also manufacturing Covishield. The vaccine was more than 90% effective in a late-stage US-based clinical trial, according to the company. The ZyCoV-D vaccine uses plasmids - or small rings of DNA that contain genetic information - to deliver the jab between two layers of the skin. The three-dose ZyCoV-D vaccine prevented symptomatic disease in 66% of those vaccinated, according to an interim study quoted by the vaccine maker Cadila Healthcare. It is also India's first needle-free Covid-19 jab - administered with a disposable needle-free injector, which uses a narrow stream of the fluid to penetrate the skin and deliver the jab to the proper tissue. Previous DNA vaccines have worked well in animals but not humans. The challenge, say scientists, was how to push the plasmid DNA into the human cell so that it gives a durable immune response. Dr Jeremy Kamil, a virologist at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in Shreveport, told the BBC that it was imperative that the efficacy data of the vaccine ""be vetted independently"". Are there any other vaccine candidates? The other candidates which are in different stages of trials in India to test safety and efficacy include: HGCO19, India's first mRNA vaccine, made by Pune-based Genova in collaboration with Seattle-based HDT Biotech Corporation, using bits of genetic code to cause an immune response A nasal vaccine by Bharat Biotech ",Unknown,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55748124
BBC,5,Covid-19 vaccine offered to children aged five to 11 in Northern Ireland,"All children aged between five and 11 in Northern Ireland are to be offered vaccinations against Covid-19. The announcement by Stormont's Department of Health follows the latest advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). Some children in this age group began receiving Covid vaccines in December. But until now, jabs were only available to children with health conditions that put them at increased risk or those who live with an immunosuppressed patient. Following the updated JCVI advice, all five to 11-year-old children in Northern Ireland will be offered two vaccine doses, to be administered at least 12 weeks apart. The injections will be 10-microgram doses of Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine. The paediatric dose is a third of the strength of an adult dose. The announcement comes after Wales,Scotland and England also announced they would be following JCVI guidance. Wales becomes first UK nation to offer jabs to younger children How do we know Covid vaccines are safe? Health Minister Robin Swann said: ""As has always been the case, our vaccination programme will continue to be guided by the expert advice. ""This announcement by the JCVI underlines the important role that the Covid-19 vaccines plays in protecting people of all ages and has only been taken after rigorous assessment of both safety and effectiveness."" Health trusts would work with the Public Health Agency to put the advice into operation and further details of the roll-out would be released shortly, he added. The JCVI said: ""This advice on the offer of vaccination to 5 to 11-year-olds who are not in a clinical risk group is considered by JCVI as a one-off pandemic response programme. ""As the Covid-19 pandemic moves further towards endemicity in the UK, JCVI will review whether, in the longer term, an offer of vaccination to this, and other paediatric age groups, continues to be advised."" The deaths of five more people who had previously tested positive for Covid-19 were reported in Northern Ireland on Wednesday, along with another 2,889 confirmed cases of the virus. On Wednesday morning there were 474 Covid-19 patients in hospital, 12 of whom were in intensive care. ",Unknown,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-60407068
Guardian,1,How the race for a Covid-19 vaccine is getting dirty,"To begin with, it felt like a sleek performance from a well-honed relay team. On 11 January, only 10 days after reporting a new respiratory disease, the Chinese published the genome sequence of the virus that causes it. Researchers around the world set to work building vaccines against Covid-19, as the disease became known, and the first candidate entered human trials on 16 March; it was joined, as the months passed, by dozens of others. Scientists were jubilant, and they had every right to be. They’d broken all vaccinology records to get to that point. But then tensions began to surface among the team members, and lately even the most distracted spectator will have noticed that they appear to be trying to nobble each other openly on the track. With accusations that the Russians and Chinese hacked research groups in other countries, biotech executives criticised for cashing in on their own, as yet unapproved vaccines, and Russia approving a vaccine that is still in clinical trials, the quest for a vaccine seems to have turned sour. Political pressure has been mounting for scientists to deliver an economy-saving result, and reports of corner-cutting emerge daily. Two days before his Republican party’s national convention began last week, president Donald Trump accused the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of dragging its feet, delaying approval of any experimental vaccine until after November’s presidential elections. When the FDA then gave “emergency use” authorisation for blood plasma treatments for Covid-19 patients before such treatments had shown any clear benefit in clinical trials, fears grew that it would do the same for a vaccine candidate before that candidate had been put fully through its paces – just to suit the presidential agenda. And Americans are laggards when it comes to cutting corners. Before Russia approved its vaccine, China also approved a locally made, but not thoroughly tested, vaccine for use in military personnel – and last week it announced that it had been administering an unapproved vaccine to key workers since July. Nor is it just politicians who are in a hurry. On 2 August, Steven Salzberg, a computational biologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, suggested in Forbes magazine that a promising vaccine be rolled out to a wider pool of volunteers before clinical trials had been completed, triggering an outcry (and some sympathy) that prompted him to recant the next day. Meanwhile, a research group with links to Harvard University continues to defend its publication in July of a recipe for a DIY Covid-19 vaccine – one that only the group’s 20-odd members had previously tested. “Out there in the real world, millions of people are getting sick and very large numbers of people are dying every day,” says group member Preston Estep, a genome scientist. “We don’t believe that our vaccine is nearly that much of a risk to people.” The accumulation of such incidents has left many scientists feeling deeply uneasy. “I’m more and more concerned that things are getting done in a rush,” says Beate Kampmann, who directs the Vaccine Centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (and whose work email account was subject to a failed hack in July). On 13 August, the editor-in-chief of the journal Science issued a call to order. “Short cuts in testing for vaccine safety and efficacy endanger millions of lives in the short term and will damage public confidence in vaccines and in science for a long time to come,” wrote H Holden Thorp. He went on to point out that the stakes are higher than with unproven therapies such as hydroxychloroquine, because a vaccine is given to healthy people. “Approval of a vaccine that is harmful or isn’t effective could be leveraged by political forces that already propagate vaccine fears,” he warned. Even if most vaccine research groups aren’t rushing, says Paul Offit, head of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, the language used to describe the search for a vaccine – the US government’s naming of its vaccine funding programme Operation “Warp Speed”, Russia’s evocation of the cold war space race with its “Sputnik V” vaccine, even the expression “vaccine race” – might imply otherwise. “It makes it sound like timelines are being suppressed, or safety issues are being ignored,” he says. Doing things by the book, where testing a vaccine – or any medical intervention – is concerned, involves putting it through a human or clinical trial. This conventionally comprises three phases. In the first, a small group of healthy people receives the vaccine to see if it is safe – that is, that it causes no serious side effects. Phase 2 continues to test safety but mainly tests the vaccine’s ability to elicit an immune response. It does this in a few hundred people, some of whom act as controls because they receive a placebo or different vaccine. In the third phase, which also includes controls, the vaccine is typically administered to tens of thousands of people who are followed over many months, usually in a place where the risk of infection is high. This tests whether the vaccine works in the real world – that it prevents disease – and attempts to root out side effects that might not have been apparent in smaller, less diverse groups. If an experimental vaccine is judged both safe and effective at the end of this process, it becomes eligible for approval. But it is universally acknowledged that clinical trials can’t catch all possible side effects – because some may only emerge in certain sub-populations, or after a very long time – so surveillance continues post-approval (this is sometimes referred to as a trial’s phase 4). A vaccine against rotavirus, a common cause of diarrhoea in infants, was taken off the market in 1999 after it was found to cause bowel obstruction in a small proportion of babies – something that, because of its rarity, trials had missed. When Russia announced earlier this month that it had approved Sputnik V, the vaccine had been tested in no more than 100 people. At the time, the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology in Moscow – which is running the ongoing vaccine trial – had registered phases 1 and 2 in public databases, but published no results from them, and given no evidence that it had even started phase 3. And this in a country that, at least until five years ago, had by its own health ministry’s admission, standards of drug safety surveillance that were lower than those recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). (Under-reporting of side effects was still a major problem in Russia in 2017.) Philosopher and bioethicist Angus Dawson, who works at the University of Sydney, says he understands the pressure to accelerate Covid-19 vaccine testing, given the numbers of people globally who are susceptible to severe or lethal forms of the disease. But he thinks it has blinkered some scientists to the dangers of rushing trials. “They’re focusing on potential benefits without reasonably and fairly thinking about the downsides,” he says. Covid-19 is not flu. It is caused by a virus, Sars-CoV-2, about which relatively little is known, and some of the experimental vaccines currently going through clinical trials also make use of novel technology. That is a lot of unknowns. “We don’t have a vaccine for any coronavirus, so why do people assume this is going to be straightforward?” Dawson asks. One potential risk with some kinds of vaccine, for example, is that they can cause the recipient to experience a worse bout of the disease if that person becomes infected naturally later on. This phenomenon, known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), has been a problem with experimental vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) – which is caused by a virus related to Sars-CoV-2 – and it will need to be ruled out by rigorous testing of vaccines against Covid-19. If ADE were to turn out to be a problem with a vaccine after it had been approved, in a country with poor safety reporting, years might pass before the full human cost came to light. This is a dilemma currently exercising the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, which is working with Covid-19 vaccine developers to set up phase 3 trials in Africa. Covid-19 outbreaks are now growing in parts of that continent, meaning it is potentially a good place to test the ability of a putative vaccine to protect people against infection, but safety surveillance can be patchy there. “Often where you have most cases of an infectious disease, the infrastructure for surveillance isn’t as good,” says Kampmann. When Salzberg rescinded his suggestion to roll out a vaccine before trials had been completed, ADE was one of the reasons. “I have concluded that (1) the risks are greater than I presented them, and (2) the benefits are not as great as I had thought,” he wrote. But unknowns are just that, meaning that experts disagree about how much speed is justified in the current situation. Dawson argues that the existing, sequential system of trial phases should be maintained, partly on moral grounds: safety should be fully established before efficacy, for example, and if it hasn’t then a volunteer giving “informed” consent to take part is less informed than she should be. But the WHO and the Oslo-based nonprofit organisation the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (Cepi) – which is helping to coordinate Covid-19 vaccine development – have both endorsed a “pandemic paradigm” in which some phases are run in parallel and trial duration is shortened overall. The front-running Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine (see graphic, below) is one of a number of projects running phase 2 and 3 trials simultaneously. The justification for doing so is that all of the usual checks and balances will still be performed before a vaccine is used widely; they just might not be performed in the same order. The cost of compressing the process is a greater financial risk for vaccine-makers, since it requires them to move forward through ever more expensive trial phases before all the information is in from previous ones – with no guarantee of approval at the end. It’s for this reason that Cepi, Warp Speed and others are investing public money in Covid-19 vaccine research – to help spread that risk. Andrew Lo, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, applauds this development. He points out that companies have been fleeing the vaccine field in recent decades, because the profit margin on most vaccines is so thin. “The fact that we now have more companies getting into the vaccine business because of Covid-19 is a tremendously positive aspect of this pandemic,” he says. But the changing economics of vaccine development have thrown up new ethical dilemmas. Nobody is suggesting that executives at Moderna and Inovio – US biotech firms working on experimental Covid-19 vaccines using technology that has never been approved – broke any rules when they sold off stock in their own companies. This is normal practice, once companies go public, partly because it allows executives to recoup their initial investment. But Lo says legal scholars are currently debating whether those rules remain fit for purpose. And while the scholars debate, the spectacle of execs cashing in on unproven technology that taxpayers helped fund – in the middle of a pandemic, to boot – does nothing for public trust in scientists. “It creates a cynicism that’s understandable,” says Offit. For Dawson, the bad behaviour now on display is evidence that commercial incentives are too dominant in the search for a vaccine. He points out that other kinds of incentives were possible. The WHO could have offered a prize for the vaccine most likely to reduce the global burden of Covid-19, for example. That might have given it some ownership of the final product, and power to ensure its equitable distribution. Unfortunately, the chronically underfunded WHO doesn’t have the authority many people think it has. “People assume it’s this global power,” Dawson says, “but my university has a bigger budget than the WHO.” The bad behaviour has repercussions. Now that seven candidates are in phase 3 trials, ensuring the equitable distribution of any that are approved has become a pressing issue. A few weeks ago Cepi published the results of a survey suggesting that the world had the manufacturing capacity to produce the 2bn doses considered necessary to protect the most vulnerable by the end of 2021 – without borrowing capacity from other lifesaving vaccines – but not to produce enough doses to protect everyone by the same deadline. “People are waking up to the fact that vaccines will not be there for all,” Kampmann says. The spectre arises of nations already engaged in a vaccine “space race” trying to corner supplies for their own populations. In fact, some have already started doing so, prompting the WHO in early August to warn against “vaccine nationalism”. To counter this, in June, Cepi, the WHO and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, set up the Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access (Covax) facility, with the aim of persuading as many governments as possible to invest in vaccine development in exchange for enough doses of an eventually approved product to cover the most vulnerable 20% of their populations. To date, 172 countries have expressed an interest in Covax. They include the UK, but not China, Russia, the US or the European Union. The deadline to commit is the end of August. Gavi CEO Seth Berkley says he hopes common sense will prevail, and specifically the realisation that nobody is safe until everybody is safe. “To go ahead and cut the final deals, though, we need to know how many countries are going to be in and to have them put in the money up front,” he says. History doesn’t give much reason to be hopeful. “In keeping with the longstanding pattern of political behaviour during pandemics,” wrote global health expert David P Fidler of the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington DC, in Science on 14 August, “vaccines will eventually reach most populations, but only after powerful countries have protected themselves.” Another potential repercussion is that, having lost faith in science and institutions, more people will choose not to take a vaccine once one becomes available – reducing the protection of the population as a whole if herd immunity cannot be achieved. (Herd immunity is when enough people are vaccinated that they block the disease’s spread, so that even the unvaccinated are protected.) Alarming surveys have suggested that up to a third of Americans and 16% of Britons would refuse a Covid-19 vaccine, for example. Offit warns that such surveys should be treated with caution, however, while the vaccine remains theoretical. “If you ask me, would I get a Covid-19 vaccine, my answer would be, not until I’ve seen the data,” he says. “People are sceptical and they should be sceptical.” If a vaccine is shown to be safe and effective, through rigorous application of the scientific method, Offit is optimistic that most people will take it. Kampmann, meanwhile, feels it’s important not to let the recent shenanigans in the vaccine community overshadow its huge achievements. If current forecasts are correct, a Covid-19 vaccine will be available in 2021 – smashing all records for vaccine development – and there will be many more reasons to trust it than not to. Still, those with their eye on that glittering prize should remember what is at stake. “We have to be careful,” she says, “because what we do with Covid-19 could have repercussions for trust in all vaccine programmes.” ",Laura Spinney,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/aug/30/how-the-race-for-a-covid-19-vaccine-got-dirty
Guardian,2,"Covid-19 vaccines: the contracts, prices and profits","Two US companies, Pfizer and Moderna, have raised the prices of their Covid-19 vaccines after data from clinical trials showed their mRNA formula was more effective than cheaper vaccines from Britain’s AstraZeneca and the American drugs maker Johnson & Johnson. AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson have pledged to provide their doses on a not-for-profit basis until the pandemic ends. Pfizer / BioNTech Sales worth $11.3bn (£8bn) were made by Pfizer in the first half of this year from the Covid-19 jab that it developed with Germany’s BioNTech. In July it lifted its 2021 sales forecast to $33.5bn. BioNTech expects to make revenues of nearly €16bn (£13.5bn) from the vaccine this year, as its first-half net profit jumped to almost €4bn from €142m a year earlier. The two firms have agreed to supply up to 1.8bn doses to the EU from December up to 2023, on top of 600m doses previously ordered this year. The US government has ordered 700m up to April next year for Americans, as well as 500m for donations to the poorest nations. Pfizer and BioNTech are aiming to produce 3bn jabs this year and 4bn next year. They are now charging the EU €19.50 per jab, up from €15.50 in the first procurement deal, the Financial Times reported. The UK is also reportedly paying more than previously, about £22 a shot for 35m doses for next year’s autumn booster campaign. Pfizer’s chief executive, Albert Bourla, recently explained the tiered pricing. “This means wealthier nations would pay about the cost of a takeaway meal for each dose … middle-income countries would pay roughly half that price … and to low-income countries we were offering them doses at cost.” Moderna This company generated nearly $6bn of sales from its Covid-19 vaccine in the first half of the year, achieving a $4bn net profit – the first half-year profit since the firm was founded in Massachusetts in 2010. Moderna has signed $20bn worth of vaccine contracts this year, including that for 17m doses to the UK, 460m to the EU and 500m to the US. It expects to produce up to 1bn jabs this year, followed by 2bn-3bn in 2022. It has charged the US government (which helped fund the development of the vaccine) up to $16.50 a dose, and has sold it for $22 to $37 outside the US. Last week the company also said that sales under the Covax vaccine initiative to low-income countries were “considerably lower than the price to the US government”. The firm has reportedly lifted the price it charges the EU to $25.50 a dose from about $19 in its first deal. AstraZeneca Revenue of $1.2bn was achieved by AstraZeneca from the vaccine it developed with the University of Oxford in the first half of the year. So far it has shipped 1bn doses globally and is aiming to produce a total of 2bn-3bn jabs this year. The UK government is in negotiations with AstraZeneca to order a new version of its vaccine adapted to tackle variants of the coronavirus. Results from clinical trials are expected later this year. The AstraZeneca jab is the cheapest of the main Covid-19 vaccines, priced at just $2.15 a dose in the company’s contract with the EU, rising to just over $5 a shot elsewhere. However, the EU has not ordered any more doses after the vaccine was linked with rare blood clots. AstraZeneca’s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said last month that “at some point in the future” the company would raise its prices, adding: “We cannot be a non-profit forever, but we will never intend to make large profits.” Novavax Denmark has ordered 280,000 doses of Novavax’s Covid-19 vaccine for $5.8m – roughly $20.90 per dose – as part of an EU deal with the US company. The European Commission said last week it would buy up to 200m doses of the vaccine, which is yet to be approved by the EU’s drugs regulator.

Guardian,3,"Texas scientists’ new Covid-19 vaccine is cheaper, easier to make and patent-free","A new Covid-19 vaccine is being developed by Texas scientists using a decades-old conventional method that will make the production and distribution cheaper and more accessible for countries most affected by the pandemic and where new variants are likely to originate due to low inoculation rates. The team, led by Drs Peter Hotez and Maria Bottazzi from the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development at Baylor College of Medicine, has been developing vaccine prototypes for Sars and Mers since 2011, which they reconstructed to create the new Covid vaccine, dubbed Corbevax, or “the world’s Covid-19 vaccine”. Although more than 60 other vaccines are in development using the same technology, Bottazzi said their vaccine is unique because they do not intend to patent it, allowing anyone with the capacity to reproduce it. “Pretty much anybody that can make hepatitis B vaccines or has the capacity to produce microbial-based protein like bacteria or yeast, can replicate what we do,” Bottazzi said. Patent wars over mRNA vaccines have recently heated up. Moderna and the National Institutes of Health are in a dispute over who should get credit for specific discoveries that led to a Covid-19 vaccine which has been delivered to more than 73 million Americans. If Moderna is found to have infringed on the federal government’s patent, it could be forced to pay more than $1bn. At the same time, activists have called for Pfizer and Moderna to share the technology and knowhow for producing their vaccines, including taking the fight to the World Trade Organization. Low-income countries, which have few vaccine research and production facilities, have vaccinated just one in nine people, according to the World Health Organization. The US has fully vaccinated 67% of the population and provided a third vaccine dose to more than one-third. Corbevax’s clinical trial data has yet to be released due to resource constraints, but Texas Children’s hospital said the vaccine was over 90% effective against the original Covid-19 strain and over 80% effective against the Delta variant. The vaccine’s efficacy against the Omicron variant is currently being tested. The process to create the vaccine involves the use of yeast – the same method by which hepatitis B vaccines are produced. The Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson vaccines currently authorized in the US use different technologies, or vaccine “platforms”. Moderna and Pfizer use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology. This platform introduces the immune system to Covid-19 by delivering instructions on how to produce its most recognizable feature, the spike proteins which coat its surface. This helps the immune system recognize and fight the virus later, if a person is exposed. Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine introduces immune cells to the spike protein through an otherwise harmless cold virus, a technology called viral vector. The Corbevax vaccine uses a platform called recombinant protein sub-unit technology, which places an actual piece of Covid-19’s spike protein in yeast cells. The yeast cells then copy the vital protein and the protein is introduced to the immune system. “We make the protein, directly and synthetically, in the lab using the yeast system,” Bottazzi explained. “We ask the yeast to make a protein that looks just like a protein that is made by the virus. Then we immunize the protein and the body then processes this protein and presents it to the immune system. Therefore, you don’t ask your body to do any major manipulation of the coding.” Crucially, storing the Corbevax vaccine only requires standard refrigeration, unlike the Pfizer vaccine, which requires ultra-cold storage in transit. Biological E, an Indian pharmaceutical company accustomed to producing hepatitis B vaccines with whom Bottazzi’s team has a longstanding relationship, has already produced 150m doses of the new Corbevax vaccine and will soon be able to produce 100m doses every month. After being overlooked by government organizations for funding, Bottazzi said, the developers behind Corbevax relied on philanthropic donations to get them over the finish line. The Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development is an academic and scientific institution in nature, but Bottazzi said developing Corbevax had forced them to stretch their resources in order to gain visibility as a serious candidate for Covid vaccine development. “We ourselves are learning how to do work that is regulatory-enabling, that enables good quality, good reproduction, good record-keeping … we mimic as if we were a small biotech or manufacturing entity,” she said. “Every technology has pros and cons. Nobody is claiming one is the super-duper, only solution. All the [vaccines] are part of the solution. But when you have a situation of such gravity around the world, you don’t pick and choose a solution – you try to use all solutions,” Bottazzi said. Bottazzi said the reason she and her team did not patent the vaccine was because of her team’s shared philosophy of humanitarianism and to engage in collaboration with the wider scientific community. “We want to do good in the world. This was the right thing to do and this is what we morally had to do. We didn’t even blink. We didn’t think, ‘how can we take advantage of this?’ You see now that if more like us would have been more attuned to how the world is so inequitable and how we could have helped from the beginning so many places around the world without thinking ‘what’s going to be in it for me?’, we could have basically not even seen these variants arise.” Bottazzi hopes her move will incentivize others to follow suit and make affordable and accessible vaccines for other diseases and viruses, like hookworm. “We need to break these paradigms that it’s only driven by economic impact factors or return of economic investment. We have to look at the return in public health.”",Erum Salam,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/15/corbevax-covid-vaccine-texas-scientists
Guardian,4,Patient removed from heart transplant list for refusing Covid-19 vaccine,"A Boston-area hospital said it will not perform a heart transplant on a patient who refuses to get a Covid-19 vaccination. DJ Ferguson, 31, was previously prioritized for a heart transplant at Brigham and Women’s hospital, but is no longer eligible as he refuses to get vaccinated, said Ferguson’s family, according to a report by CBS Boston. “It’s kind of against his basic principles – he doesn’t believe in it,” said David Ferguson, his father. “It’s a policy they are enforcing and so, because he won’t get the shot, they took him off the list [for] a heart transplant.” Brigham and Women’s explained its reasoning in a statement: “Like many other transplant programs in the United States – the Covid-19 vaccine is one of several vaccines and lifestyle behaviors required for transplant candidates in the Mass General Brigham system in order to create both the best chance for a successful operation and also the patient’s survival after transplantation.” Other medical experts have declared their support of the hospital’s policy, noting that the immune system is extremely weak after a transplant, making vaccinations all the more important. “Post any transplant, kidney, heart whatever, your immune system is shut off. The flu could kill you, a cold could kill you, Covid could kill you,” said Dr Arthur Caplan, the head of medical ethics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, told CBS Boston. “The organs are scarce: we are not going to distribute them to someone who has a poor chance of living when others who are vaccinated have a better chance post-surgery of surviving.” Ferguson’s family have said they are unsure of what to do next given his refusal to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. They have considered transferring him to a different facility but acknowledge he might not survive the trip. “We are aggressively pursuing all options, but we are running out of time,” said David Ferguson. The family said that while had received excellent care at Brigham and Women’s, they do not agree with the policy. “I think my boy is fighting pretty damn courageously, and he has integrity and principles he really believes in, and that makes me respect him all the more,” said Ferguson of his son, who is a father of two children with another one on the way. “It’s his body. It’s his choice.”",Gloria Oladipo,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/25/heart-transplant-patient-refusing-covid-19-vaccine
Guardian,5,World leaders pledge €7.4bn to research Covid-19 vaccine,"World leaders, with the notable exception of Donald Trump, stumped up nearly €7.4bn (£6.5bn) to research Covid-19 vaccines and therapies at a virtual event convened by the EU, pledging the money will also be used to distribute any vaccine to poor countries on time and equitably. But in a sign of the fractured state of global health diplomacy, the event was not addressed by India, Russia or the US. After a weekend of persuasion, China was represented by its ambassador to the EU. A separate Covid-19 summit was staged earlier in the day and addressed by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, and other world leaders including the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani. The EU-convened virtual summit was addressed in person by the leaders of France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Canada, Japan, Jordan, Norway, Israel, South Africa and the EU, and took the form of a pledging marathon. But the US state department released a statement welcoming what it described as “the pledging conference in Europe”, even though the fundraising summit had always been envisaged as a global, rather than strictly European effort. The US also highlighted its “vaccine partnership to prioritise drug candidates and streamline clinical trials”. Trump has suggested a vaccine will be ready by the end of the year but many scientists are sceptical that even with global cooperation such a timetable can be met. The money is largely designed to speed up the process by raising guaranteed funds to coordinate research and incentivise pharmaceutical companies to distribute any vaccines and therapies to poorer countries, something that did not happen in the 2009 swine flu outbreak. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said any distributed vaccine “won’t belong to anybody”. “Those who invent it of course will be fairly paid, but access will be given to people across the globe by the organisation we chose,” he said. EU officials said pharmaceutical companies who will receive the funding will not be requested to forgo their intellectual property rights on the new vaccine and treatments, but they should commit to make them available worldwide at affordable prices. A similar process has occurred through Gavi, the global vaccine fund, which gives a global alliance leverage over the distribution and price of a vaccine. Boris Johnson was introduced to the summit by Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, as “a man who has been though every possible emotion in the past month”. The UK prime minister insisted the search for a vaccine was not a competition between countries, but instead required cooperation that “defies the usual ways of operating”. He said: “We’ll need a truly global effort – because no one country, and no one pharmaceutical company, will be able to do this alone. The race to discover the vaccine to defeat this virus is not a competition between countries, but the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes. It’s humanity against the virus.” Many leaders used their brief speeches to assert their support for the existing multilateral architecture for global health, including the World Health Organization. The US last month suspended funding for the WHO, criticising its relationship with China. Erna Solberg, the Norwegian prime minister and summit co-host, said “we support the leadership of the World Health Organization”, adding that without the UN body “an effective and coordinated response to the pandemic would not be possible”. She said that “multilateral cooperation is more important than ever” and the meeting was the start of a global movement “never seen before”. At the parallel “non-aligned movement” summit, Rouhani attacked the US decision to pull out of the WHO, describing it as “a strategic blunder”. The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom, in his address to the EU-convened event , pointed out how quickly the genetic sequence of the virus had been shared by China amongst scientists globally. The EU said near the close of the summit that a total of 7.36bn of the €7.5bn sought had been pledged, with the largest national pledges coming from Japan and Norway. France, Italy and Germany all pledged around €500m each. Turkey’s contribution will be announced later in the month. The precise value of individual countries pledges announced during the two-hour event was hard to calculate since some leaders drew on previous pledges, or earmarked their national contribution for specific bodies like the Red Cross, the WHO or Gavi. Von der Leyen said the summit had revealed “fantastic momentum” and that it was possible to turn the tide against the virus. From the €7.5bn initially sought, €4bn is for the development of a vaccine, €2bn for treatments and €1.5bn for the manufacture of tests, according to the European commission. The precise methodology of the new fund, including how to select a vaccine for funding and the strings to be attached, was not made clear during the many rhetorical speeches. But the world leaders want to work with existing global health bodies such as Gavi as much as possible. The driving idea behind the summit, pushed by the Gates Foundation, is that an alliance is needed not just to coordinate research for a vaccine, but also for therapies and testing. Jeremy Farrar, the Wellcome Trust director, said: “I would have loved China and the US to be part of the fundraising summit … both countries had incredibly deep medical knowledge innovation and expertise and a strong manufacturing base.” He added: “My guess is that those countries that have not yet signed up will sign up in the course of May to make sure this is a truly global event. We need everyone.” David Salisbury from the thinktank Chatham House noted, however: “We have to admit there is a tension between countries that want to protect their populations and the desire to spread the vaccine equitably. It will not be a vote winner to offer a share in available vaccine to less-privileged countries. “The factories for the biggest vaccine manufacturers are in Europe, the US and India. Will European manufacturers be obliged by the EU to restrict sales first to European countries?”",Patrick Wintour,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/world-leaders-pledge-74bn-euros-to-research-covid-19-vaccine
